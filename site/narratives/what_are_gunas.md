# 🎨 What Are the Gunas? (The Three Render Settings)

> *"Every moment of your life is a mix of three settings."*

---

## The Three Quality Parameters

Everything in the rendered reality is composed of three fundamental qualities:

| Guna | Sanskrit | Color | Quality | In Games |
|------|----------|-------|---------|----------|
| **Sattva** | सत्त्व | White/Light | Clarity, Balance, Awareness | High graphics, smooth framerate |
| **Rajas** | रजस् | Red | Activity, Passion, Motion | Action mode, high CPU usage |
| **Tamas** | तमस् | Black/Dark | Inertia, Heaviness, Resistance | Lag, buffer, loading screen |

---

## The Rule: S + R + T = 1

At every moment, at every scale:

```
Sattva + Rajas + Tamas = 1.0 (100%)

You can't have more than 100% total.
If one increases, others decrease.

Examples:
• Meditation: S=0.7, R=0.2, T=0.1 (clarity)
• Workout: S=0.2, R=0.7, T=0.1 (activity)
• Just woke up: S=0.1, R=0.2, T=0.7 (inertia)
```

## How Gunas Affect Your Experience

### Time Perception

```
TIME FORMULA:
L_m = (D × S) / (R + 2T)

WHERE:
L_m = How long a moment feels
D = Era (Yuga) factor
S = Sattva %
T = Tamas %
R = Rajas %

HIGH SATTVA = Time slows, you're present
HIGH TAMAS = Time flies, you miss life
```

### States of Mind

| State | Sattva | Rajas | Tamas | Experience |
|-------|--------|-------|-------|------------|
| **Flow State** | 80% | 15% | 5% | Time stops, clarity |
| **Anxiety** | 10% | 80% | 10% | Racing mind, stress |
| **Depression** | 10% | 10% | 80% | Heavy, stuck, slow |
| **Balanced** | 33% | 33% | 33% | Normal waking |
| **Deep Sleep** | 0% | 0% | 100% | Unconscious |

## Gunas in Physics

The three Gunas map to fundamental physics:

| Guna | Physics Equivalent | Example |
|------|-------------------|---------|
| **Sattva** | Negentropy, Order | Crystals forming, life organizing |
| **Rajas** | Kinetic Energy, Motion | Particles moving, waves propagating |
| **Tamas** | Entropy, Mass, Inertia | Gravity, resistance, decay |

## Changing Your Guna Mix

You can consciously shift your composition:

### To Increase Sattva (Clarity)
- Meditation
- Pure food (fresh, vegetarian)
- Nature
- Morning sunlight
- Truthfulness

### To Decrease Tamas (Inertia)
- Exercise
- Cold showers
- Fasting
- Early rising
- Less sleep

### To Balance Rajas (Activity)
- Breathwork
- Purposeful action (not frantic)
- Service to others
- Completing tasks

---

## The Goal

The goal isn't to be 100% Sattva all the time.

The goal is to **consciously choose** your Guna mix based on what you need:

- Need clarity? -> Increase Sattva
- Need action? -> Increase Rajas
- Need rest? -> Allow Tamas (but not too much)

And ultimately: **Transcend all three** (Moksha) — become the player, not the settings.

---

## Summary

```
THE GUNAS ARE YOUR RENDER SETTINGS:

• SATTVA = Graphics quality (clarity)
• RAJAS = CPU usage (activity)
• TAMAS = System lag (resistance)

Total always equals 100%.
You can change the mix.
Master the mix, master the game.
```
