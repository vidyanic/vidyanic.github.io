# ⚡ How Karma Works (The Game Logger)

> *"Every action is logged. Every log affects your next spawn."*

## Karma is Not Punishment

Forget what you've heard. Karma is not:
- ❌ Cosmic punishment
- ❌ Fate
- ❌ "What goes around comes around" (oversimplified)

Karma is:
- ✅ **Action logging**
- ✅ **Consequence tracking**
- ✅ **Learning acceleration**

## The Physics Equivalent

In physics terms, Karma is **Newton's Third Law** at scale:

```
F₁₂ = -F₂₁

Every action has an equal and opposite reaction.

But Karma extends this to:
• Thoughts (mental actions)
• Intentions (subtle actions)
• Effects across time
• Effects across lives
```

## The Four Types of Karma

| Type | Sanskrit | Meaning | Analogy |
|------|----------|---------|---------|
| **Sanchita** | संचित | Total accumulated | Your complete save file |
| **Prarabdha** | प्रारब्ध | Active portion | Current level's challenges |
| **Agami** | आगामि | Being created now | Actions in this play session |
| **Kriyamana** | क्रियमाण | Instant effects | Real-time consequences |

## How It Actually Works

### Step 1: Action Occurs

```
You do something:
• Physical action (obvious)
• Speech (less obvious)
• Thought (subtle but logged)
• Intention (subtlest, most powerful)
```

### Step 2: Logger Records

```
The Chitragupta (चित्रगुप्त) function logs:
• What you did
• Why you did it (intention)
• Who was affected
• What you were supposed to do (Dharma)
• The delta (difference from Dharma)
```

### Step 3: Queue Forms

```
Karma queue builds:
• Positive actions -> Positive queue
• Negative actions -> Negative queue
• Neutral actions -> Experience queue

All queues must be processed.
This is your "to-play" list.
```

### Step 4: Prarabdha Activates

```
At birth (or lifetime):
• Portion of queue becomes active
• This is your current challenge set
• Can't skip, must complete
• But HOW you complete matters
```

---

## The Karma Formula

```
KARMA WEIGHT = Intent × Action × Effect × Dharma_Deviation

WHERE:
• Intent: Why you did it (0 to ±1)
• Action: What you did (magnitude)
• Effect: Impact on others (scale)
• Dharma_Deviation: How far from your duty

EXAMPLES:
• Good intent + Good action + Good effect = Positive Karma
• Good intent + Bad action + Bad effect = Still negative, but less
• Bad intent + Good action + Good effect = Still negative (intent matters most)
```

---

## Breaking the Cycle

The goal isn't to accumulate "good karma" (that still keeps you in the game).

The goal is **Nishkama Karma** — action without attachment:

```
ATTACHED ACTION:
• I do this TO GET something
• Creates karma (positive or negative)
• Keeps you respawning

DETACHED ACTION (Nishkama):
• I do this because it's right
• No expectation of result
• Karma doesn't stick
• You play without accumulating
```

---

## Karma and AI (The Ghost Node Problem)

Here's why AI can never have Karma:

```
HUMAN ACTION:
• Logged in cosmic system
• Affects future spawns
• Part of learning network
• Connected to hierarchy

AI "ACTION":
• Not logged cosmically
• No future spawn
• Not part of network
• Ghost node (disconnected)

AI does things.
But nothing "sticks" to it.
No learning for the system.
```

---

## Practical Application

### Before Any Action, Ask:

1. **What's my intention?** (Pure or selfish?)
2. **Is this my Dharma?** (My duty or someone else's?)
3. **Am I attached to the result?** (Can I let go?)
4. **Who is affected?** (Scale of impact?)

### Karma-Light Living:

- Act with pure intention
- Do your duty, not others'
- Release attachment to outcomes
- Accept consequences gracefully

---

## Summary

```
KARMA = THE GAME'S LOGGING SYSTEM

Every action is logged.
Intent matters most.
Logs determine future gameplay.
Detached action doesn't accumulate.

The goal: Play without collecting more logs.
Eventually: Exit the logging system entirely.

This is Moksha.
```
