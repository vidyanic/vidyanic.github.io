## About the Project

### What is Project Shunya-0?

Project Shunya-0 documents the "backend source code" of reality as described in Vedic texts. It maps modern physics, biology, and consciousness research to ancient Vedic cosmology, showing how:
- Reality is rendered (like a simulation)
- Consciousness is fundamental (not emergent)
- The universe operates on specific laws (Dharma)
- Liberation is possible (Moksha)

### Why "Shunya-0"?

**Shunya (शून्य)** means "void" or "zero" in Sanskrit. It represents:
- The potential before manifestation
- The number zero
- The emptiness from which form emerges
- The state of pure consciousness

The "0" emphasizes: From nothing comes everything.

### Is this religious?

No. This is a **framework** for understanding reality, using Vedic terminology. Think of it as:
- Vedas = Ancient source code documentation
- This project = Modern interpretation with physics mapping

You don't need to believe anything. Test the claims against your experience.

## Core Concepts

### What is "reality is rendered"?

Just like video games only render what you're looking at, reality appears to "render" upon observation:
- Quantum mechanics: Particles exist in superposition until measured
- Observer effect: Measurement changes the system
- Maya (माया): The cosmic rendering engine

**This isn't metaphor** — it's what physics experiments show.

### Who/what is Brahman?

Brahman (ब्रह्मन्) is:
- Pure consciousness (not a god)
- The substrate of reality
- What you truly are (Atman = Brahman)
- Beyond all descriptions

Think: Not the movie, but the screen on which movies play.

### What are the Gunas?

The three fundamental qualities (Gunas) that combine in all things:

| Guna | Quality | Physical Manifestation |
|------|---------|----------------------|
| **Sattva** | Clarity, lightness | Light, knowledge |
| **Rajas** | Activity, energy | Motion, change |
| **Tamas** | Inertia, heaviness | Mass, gravity |

Everything is a mix: S + R + T = 1 (always).

### What is Karma?

Karma literally means "action." It's the principle that:
- Every action has consequences
- These consequences shape future experience
- It's not punishment — it's cause and effect

Like Newton's Third Law applied to all action.

### What is Moksha?

Moksha (मोक्ष) = Liberation. It means:
- Recognizing your true nature (Atman = Brahman)
- Ending identification with the body-mind
- Not "escaping" but awakening within
- The "exit function" from the game

## Science Questions

### Does modern science support this?

Many findings align remarkably:
- **Quantum mechanics:** Observer-dependent reality
- **Thermodynamics:** Entropy (Tamas) increases
- **Cymatics:** Sound creates form (Shabda -> Rupa)
- **Cosmology:** Fine-tuned constants
- **Neuroscience:** Consciousness still unexplained

We don't claim "proof" — we show **correspondence**.

### What is the 7-Concept Validation Stack?

Every claim must satisfy these 7 principles:

1. **Conservation:** Energy/information preserved
2. **Entropy:** Disorder increases over time
3. **Fractal:** Same pattern at all scales
4. **Karma:** Every action has consequence
5. **Observer:** Observation affects observed
6. **Cycles:** Patterns repeat periodically
7. **Gunas:** Three qualities always present

### How confident are the papers?

Each paper includes a confidence score (typically 75-95%). This reflects:
- Strength of physics evidence
- Clarity of Vedic correspondence
- Reproducibility of claims
- Falsifiability considerations

We're transparent about uncertainty.

## Practical Questions

### How do I start?

1. **Quick:** Read [Why Reality is Rendered](./narratives/why_reality_is_rendered.md)
2. **Deeper:** Explore [Narratives](./narratives/) section
3. **Foundation:** Explore [Index of how to browse](../scientific_papers/01_FOUNDATION/FOUNDATION_MAPPING.md)
4. **Practical:** Try [Daily Sadhana](./practical/01_DAILY_SADHANA.md)
5. **Academic:** Browse [Research Papers](../scientific_papers/)

### Is meditation required?

Not required, but helpful. Meditation allows you to:
- Observe your own mind
- Experience witness consciousness
- Verify claims through direct experience

See: [Meditation Guide](./practical/02_MEDITATION_GUIDE.md)

### Can I use this with other traditions?

Yes. The framework maps to many traditions:
- Buddhism: Maya ~ Samsara, Moksha ~ Nirvana
- Christianity: Brahman ~ God, Atman ~ Soul
- Simulation Theory: Maya ~ Simulation
- Taoism: Brahman ~ Tao, Gunas ~ Yin-Yang-Flow

Core truths appear across cultures.

## Technical Questions

### What is the Three-Track Architecture?

The project has three separate tracks:

| Track | Purpose | Location |
|-------|---------|----------|
| **Track 1** | Research papers (academic) | `scientific_papers/` |
| **Track 2** | Technical specs (engine) | `vishnu_engine/` |
| **Track 3** | User content (stories) | `site/` |

Each serves different audiences and purposes.

### What is the Vishnu Engine?

The "Vishnu Engine" is our conceptual model of reality's architecture:
- Backend specs for how consciousness manifests matter
- Entity hierarchies (quantum to cosmic)
- Karma calculation system
- Rendering mechanics

It's both metaphor and technical specification.

### How are papers structured?

Each research paper has 14 sections:
1. Abstract
2. Introduction
3. Literature Review
4. Theoretical Framework
5. Hypothesis
6. Methodology
7. Results
8. Anomalies
9. Backend Analogy
10. Discussion
11. Validation (7-concept stack)
12. Conclusion
13. References
14. Appendices

Plus a README for quick reference.

## Skeptic Questions

### Isn't this just pseudoscience?

We distinguish between:
- **Claims:** Vedic texts make specific assertions
- **Correspondences:** Modern physics shows aligned patterns
- **Speculation:** What we don't know

We don't claim ancient texts are "science." We show the **mapping** and let readers evaluate.

### Can any of this be tested?

Many aspects can be tested:
- Observer effect experiments (done extensively)
- Cymatics experiments (reproducible)
- Meditation effects (studied)
- NDE research (ongoing)

Some claims (Moksha, reincarnation) are harder to test conventionally.

### Why use Sanskrit terms?

Sanskrit terms are precise. For example:
- "Maya" has no English equivalent (not just "illusion")
- "Dharma" means law + duty + nature combined
- "Karma" is more than "what goes around"

We use English explanations alongside Sanskrit for clarity.
