## 1. Understanding Your Gunas {#1-understand}

### 1.1 The Three Forces

Everything in nature (including you) is made of three qualities:

| Guna | Quality | Feeling | Energy |
|------|---------|---------|--------|
| **Sattva** | Harmony | Peace, clarity | Light, upward |
| **Rajas** | Activity | Restless, driven | Heat, outward |
| **Tamas** | Inertia | Dull, stuck | Heavy, downward |

### 1.2 They're Always Mixed

    "Tamas 🌑" : 20

    style R fill:#FFF8E1,stroke:#D97706
    style T fill:#ECEFF1,stroke:#607D8B
```

**S + R + T = 100% (always).** Your mix varies moment to moment based on food, sleep, media, and actions.

### 1.3 They Change Constantly

- Morning: Higher Sattva (naturally)
- Afternoon: Higher Rajas (activity peak)
- Night: Higher Tamas (sleep preparation)
- After food: Depends on what you ate
- After media: Depends on what you consumed

## 4. Reducing Rajas {#4-rajas}

### 4.1 Rajasic Triggers

| Trigger | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Stimulants | Coffee, tea, energy drinks |
| Hot/spicy food | Increases agitation |
| Competition | Comparison, envy |
| Excessive exercise | Depletes and agitates |
| News/social media | Creates urgency/anxiety |
| Rushing | Perpetuates restlessness |

### 4.2 Reducing Rajas

**Don't try to stop — redirect:**

| Instead of... | Do This... |
|---------------|------------|
| Rushing | Pause, breathe, then proceed |
| Multitasking | One thing at a time |
| Checking phone constantly | Designated times only |
| Overscheduling | Build in empty space |
| Competitive exercise | Yoga, walking, swimming |
| Stimulants | Herbal teas, warm water |

### 4.3 Rajas-to-Sattva Conversion

```
PRACTICAL TECHNIQUE:
====================
When you feel Rajasic (restless, driven, agitated):

1. PAUSE (physically stop)
2. BREATHE (5 slow breaths)
3. FEEL (body sensations, not thoughts)
4. ASK: "What is essential right now?"
5. PROCEED (with presence, not urgency)

This converts Rajas -> Sattva
```

## 5. Transforming Tamas {#5-tamas}

### 5.1 Tamasic Triggers

| Trigger | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Oversleeping | Creates more Tamas |
| Heavy food | Meat, fried, old food |
| Intoxicants | Alcohol, drugs |
| Isolation | Depression, inertia |
| Darkness | Physical and mental |
| Inactivity | Body becomes tamasic |

### 5.2 Breaking Tamas

**You need Rajas first!**

```
TAMAS -> RAJAS -> SATTVA
(Can't skip steps)

When deep in Tamas:
1. MOVE — Any movement (walk, stretch)
2. LIGHT — Open curtains, go outside
3. WATER — Splash cold water, drink water
4. SOUND — Upbeat music, mantras
5. COMPANY — Be around active people
6. ACCOMPLISH — One small task (makes momentum)
```

### 5.3 Tamasic Patterns

| Pattern | Breaking Point |
|---------|----------------|
| Can't get out of bed | Count 5-4-3-2-1, swing legs over |
| Procrastination | Do the smallest piece only |
| Overeating | Stop mid-bite, drink water |
| Binge watching | Set timer, honor it |
| Depression | Move first, think later |
