• Minimum 2 hours daily Sadhana
• Regular fasting (Ekadashi + more)
• Telepathic practice with trusted group
• Healing service to others
• Living as example

EXPECT:
• Clear distinction between old/new frequency
• Some people "disappearing" from your life
• New people appearing
• Clarity about life purpose
• Reality responding to intention faster

WARNING:
• Don't abandon those still transitioning
• Remain humble despite progress
• Continue learning (never complete)
```

### 2028: FULL ACTIVATION

```
FOCUS: Stabilize in Dwapara frequency

BY END OF 2028:
□ Karma-return in real-time (accepted as normal)
□ Telepathic sensitivity developed
□ Energy perception established
□ Community of practice thriving
□ Teaching/serving actively
□ Independence from Kali-systems
□ Living Dharma naturally
□ Ready for next phase

THE NEW NORMAL:
• Siddhis are tools, not goals
• Service is the purpose
• Bliss is the background state
• Karma is entertainment, not burden
• You are consciousness playing human
