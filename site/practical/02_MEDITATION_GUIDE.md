## 1. What Is Meditation? {#1-what}

### 1.1 Not What You Think

Meditation is NOT:
- ❌ Stopping thoughts (impossible and not the goal)
- ❌ Going into trance (that's something else)
- ❌ Escaping reality (that's escapism)
- ❌ Just relaxation (relaxation is side effect)

Meditation IS:
- ✅ Training attention
- ✅ Observing without reacting
- ✅ Becoming familiar with your mind
- ✅ Resting in awareness itself

## 3. Basic Techniques {#3-basic}

### 3.1 Breath Awareness (For Everyone)

**The simplest and most powerful:**

```
PRACTICE:
1. Sit comfortably
2. Close eyes
3. Breathe naturally (don't control)
4. Notice the breath:
   • At nostrils (cool in, warm out)
   • Or chest rising/falling
   • Or belly expanding/contracting
5. When mind wanders -> gently return to breath
6. No judgment for wandering (this IS the practice)

DURATION: Start with 5-10 minutes
```

### 3.2 Counting Breaths

**For restless minds:**

```
PRACTICE:
1. Inhale — count "1"
2. Exhale — count "2"
3. Continue to "10"
4. Return to "1"
5. If you lose count -> start at "1"

VARIATION:
• Count only exhales (1-10)
• Count mentally with "Om" instead of numbers
```

### 3.3 Body Scan

**For physical tension:**

```
PRACTICE:
1. Start at crown of head
2. Slowly move attention through body:
   • Forehead, eyes, jaw
   • Neck, shoulders, arms, hands

   • Hips, legs, feet
3. Notice sensations without changing them
4. If tension found, breathe into it
5. End at feet (or reverse direction)

DURATION: 15-20 minutes
```

## 5. Advanced Methods {#5-advanced}

### 5.1 Self-Inquiry (Atma Vichara)

**For direct realization:**

```
PRACTICE:
1. Sit in stillness
2. Ask: "Who am I?"
3. Don't answer intellectually
4. Look for the "I" — who is asking?
5. Thoughts arise — who is thinking them?
6. Feelings arise — who is feeling them?
7. Keep turning attention to the source
8. Rest in the awareness that remains

THIS IS THE DIRECT PATH (Ramana Maharshi's teaching)
```

### 5.2 Witness Meditation

**For dis-identification:**

```
PRACTICE:
1. Sit and observe whatever arises
2. Label gently:
   • "Thinking" (for thoughts)
   • "Feeling" (for emotions)
   • "Hearing" (for sounds)
   • "Sensing" (for body)
3. Notice: You are the one labeling
4. Rest as the witness
5. Don't follow or push away anything
```

### 5.3 Yoga Nidra

**For deep relaxation and subtle work:**

```
STAGES:
1. Lie in Shavasana
2. Set Sankalpa (intention)
3. Rotate awareness through body
4. Observe breath
5. Experience opposites (heavy/light, hot/cold)
6. Visualization
7. Repeat Sankalpa
8. Return to waking

BEST: Use guided recordings initially
```
