## 📊 USAGE INSTRUCTIONS

### For Midjourney:
```
/imagine [paste full prompt] --ar [ratio] --v 6 --style raw --s 250 --q 2
```

### For DALL-E 3:
```
Use prompt as-is, may need to simplify for length limits.
Focus on key visual elements and style.
```

### For Stable Diffusion:
```
Add negative prompts: 
"blurry, low quality, distorted, ugly, chaotic, random, meaningless"

Add style modifiers:
"highly detailed, 8k, masterpiece, professional, award-winning"
```

---

## 🎯 CUSTOMIZATION TIPS

### If prompt is too long:
1. Use the "COMPOSITION" and "STYLE" sections only
2. Add specific details in iterations
3. Focus on 2-3 key elements first

### If results are not accurate:
1. Emphasize the key symbols
2. Add reference images if tool supports
3. Use negative prompts to exclude unwanted elements

### For different tools:
- **Midjourney:** Best for artistic interpretation
- **DALL-E 3:** Best for precise composition
- **Stable Diffusion:** Best for iterative refinement
- **Runway/Pika:** Best for animated versions
