## 🌀 A Different Perspective on Reality

You know that feeling when a video game glitches? When the NPC walks through a wall, or the physics breaks for a second?

**What if games are ACCURATE — and THIS reality has the same glitches?**

| You Experience... | Science Says... | Architecture View | Universal Meaning |
|-------------------|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| ⚛️ Observation creates reality | "Wave function collapse" | **GPU Optimization / Lazy Loading** | Don't render what nobody's watching |
| 🌌 95% of universe invisible | "Dark matter/energy" | **Unloaded Game Levels** | Other maps/dimensions not loaded for you |
| 🧠 Can't find consciousness | "Hard problem" | **Player vs. Avatar** | Looking for player inside the character |
| ☯️ Brain death experiences | "Hallucination?" | **VR Headset Removed** | Game paused, you (player) still aware |
| 🔗 Instant connection | "Spooky action" | **Same Memory Pointer** | Two icons, one file on disk |
| ⏱️ Time dilation | "Subjective perception" | **Variable Frame Rate** | Lag in the game, not in your mind |

**The Backend Framework describes this source code architecture.**  
**Scientists are just now finding the glitches that prove them right.**

## 🔗 KEY CONCEPTS

| Concept | Sanskrit | Systemic Logic | Universal Meaning |
|---------|----------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Brahman** | ब्रह्मन् | Root Process / Source Code | The player (you), not the game |
| **Maya** | माया | Render Engine / Graphics API | Like Unreal/Unity engine |
| **Prakriti** | प्रकृति | Physics Engine / Game Rules | Like Havok physics |
| **Gunas** | गुण | RGB Values / State Variables | Three base qualities (S+R+T=1) |
| **Karma** | कर्म | Event Logger / Save System | Every action logged & has consequences |
| **Dharma** | धर्म | Game Rules / Operating System | The law code that runs everything |
| **Moksha** | मोक्ष | Exit Function | Exit the execution loop |

---

## 📜 VALIDATION FRAMEWORK

Every paper passes the **7-Concept Stack**:

1. ✅ **Conservation** - Energy/info preserved
2. ✅ **Entropy** - Tamas increases
3. ✅ **Fractal** - Patterns scale
4. ✅ **Karma** - Action -> consequence
5. ✅ **Observer** - Observation creates reality
6. ✅ **Cycles** - Yugas repeat
7. ✅ **Gunas** - S+R+T = 1 always
