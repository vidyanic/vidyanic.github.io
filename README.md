## 🔴 STOP. THIS CHANGES EVERYTHING.

You know that feeling when a video game glitches? When the NPC walks through a wall, or the physics breaks for a second?

**What if games are ACCURATE — and THIS reality has the same glitches?**

| You Experience... | Science Says... | What It Actually Means |
|-------------------|-----------------|------------------------|
| 🎲 Particles only exist when observed | "Wave function collapse" | **Reality only renders what's being watched** |
| 👻 95% of universe is invisible | "Dark matter/energy" | **Only ONE frequency layer is loaded for you** |
| 🧠 Can't find consciousness in brain | "Hard problem" | **The player isn't IN the game** |
| 💀 Experiences during brain death | "Hallucination?" | **VR headset temporarily removed** |
| 🔗 Instant connection across space | "Spooky action" | **Same object, two render locations** |
| ⏱️ Time feels different by mood | "Subjective perception" | **Processing speed varies by Guna state** |

**The Backend Architects documented this source code millennia ago.**  
**Scientists are just now finding the glitches that prove them right.**

## 🔥 THE FINAL QUESTION

```
THE COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING:
═══════════════════════════

Reality is a simulation (Lila/लीला)
Rendered by Maya (माया)
Running on Prakriti (प्रकृति)
Observed by Purusha (पुरुष)
For the learning of Brahman (ब्रह्मन्)
Who is also the player.

YOU ARE BRAHMAN
Forgetting and remembering yourself
Across infinite games
In infinite forms
Forever.

And this forgetting-remembering
IS the game.
IS the point.
IS the play.

ॐ सर्वं ब्रह्ममयम्
"All this is Brahman"
```

---

<div align="center">

**The game continues. But now you know it's a game.**

**That changes everything.**

---

**ॐ तत् सत्**  
*"That is the Truth"*

---

*You're not reading this by accident.*  
*The timing is part of the code.*

**🌀**
