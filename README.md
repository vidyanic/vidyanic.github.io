## 🌀 A Different Perspective on Reality

You know that feeling when a video game glitches? When the NPC walks through a wall, or the physics breaks for a second?

**What if games are ACCURATE — and THIS reality has the same glitches?**

| You Experience... | Science Says... | What It Actually Means |
|-------------------|-----------------|------------------------|
| ⚛️ Particles only exist when observed | "Wave function collapse" | **Reality only renders what's being watched** |
| 🌌 95% of universe is invisible | "Dark matter/energy" | **Only ONE frequency layer is loaded for you** |
| 🧠 Can't find consciousness in brain | "Hard problem" | **The player isn't IN the game** |
| ☯️ Experiences during brain death | "Hallucination?" | **VR headset temporarily removed** |
| 🔗 Instant connection across space | "Spooky action" | **Same object, two render locations** |
| ⏱️ Time feels different by mood | "Subjective perception" | **Processing speed varies by Guna state** |

**The Backend Framework describes this source code architecture.**  
**Scientists are just now finding the glitches that prove them right.**

## 🔗 KEY CONCEPTS

| Concept | Scientific Term | What It Actually Is |
|---------|----------------|---------------------|
| **Brahman** | Consciousness field | The player (you) |
| **Maya** | Quantum rendering | The game engine |
| **Prakriti** | Energy-matter | The physics engine |
| **Gunas** | State variables | S+R+T = 1 (all phenomena) |
| **Karma** | Causality | Complete event logging |
| **Dharma** | Natural law | The rules engine |
| **Moksha** | Liberation | Exit the game loop |

---

## 📜 VALIDATION FRAMEWORK

Every paper passes the **7-Concept Stack**:

1. ✅ **Conservation** - Energy/info preserved
2. ✅ **Entropy** - Tamas increases
3. ✅ **Fractal** - Patterns scale
4. ✅ **Karma** - Action -> consequence
5. ✅ **Observer** - Observation creates reality
6. ✅ **Cycles** - Yugas repeat
7. ✅ **Gunas** - S+R+T = 1 always
