   ----------------------------------------                                    
                                                                              
   Root: बृह् (Brh) = "To expand/grow without limit"

   Ratio 0 — COMPLETELY INVISIBLE                                             
   Cannot be seen, measured, or inferred by instruments

   THIS IS NOT A "LEVEL" — IT IS THE SUBSTRATE

   BRAHMAN EXISTS IN TWO "VIEWS" (Not two entities):

   | (निर्गुण — Without Qualities) | (सगुण — With Qualities)                |
   -------------------------------------------------------------------------
   | The Absolute Truth           | The Manifested Reality                 |
   | Beyond time, space, Gunas    | Within time, space, Gunas              |
   | The Dreamer                  | The Dream                              |
   | The Screen                   | The Movie                              |
   | Hardware before BIOS         | Hardware + BIOS + OS + Apps            |

   Saguna Brahman = Nirguna Brahman + Maya (Rendering Engine)                 
                                                                              
   They are NOT different substances — different VIEWS of the same

## 3. Why N+5 is Invisible {#3-invisible}

```
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                              
   THE M=N IMPOSSIBILITY EXTENDED                                             
   --------------------------------                                            
                                                                              
   At N+5, from Human (N):                                                    
   • Offset = 5 levels                                                        
   • Dharma-Pada Ratio = 0/4 = INVISIBLE                                      
                                                                              
   ANALOGY:                                                                    
   You cannot see the TV while you are a character in the show.               
   The TV screen is at "N+5" — completely outside your rendering.             
                                                                              
   WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU "LOOK UP" TO N+5:                                    
   • N+1 (Plants): You see the tree (frontend)                                
   • N+2 (Earth): You see the ground (frontend)                               
   • N+3 (Sun): You see the light (15th axis only)                            
   • N+4 (Galaxy): You see "constants" (laws of physics)                      
   • N+5 (Brahman): You see NOTHING — appears as "void" or "unknown"          
                                                                              
   THE VOID IS NOT EMPTY — YOU CANNOT RENDER IT

   TO "SEE" BRAHMAN, YOU MUST EXIT THE RENDERER                               
   ---------------------------------------------                               
                                                                              
   THE FOUR PATHS:                                                             
                                                                              
   1. ज्ञान-योग (Jnana Yoga) — Path of Knowledge                              
      • "Neti Neti" (Not this, Not this)                                      
      • Remove all that is NOT Brahman                                        
      • What remains IS Brahman                                                
                                                                              
   2. भक्ति-योग (Bhakti Yoga) — Path of Devotion                              
      • Surrender to Ishvara (Saguna form)                                    
      • Ishvara reveals Nirguna in Grace                                      
      • The beloved becomes the Beloved

      • Act without attachment                                                 
      • Offer all results to Brahman                                          
      • Actor dissolves into the Action                                        
                                                                              
   4. राज-योग (Raja Yoga) — Path of Meditation                                
      • Quiet the Vrittis (Mind waves)                                        
      • Enter Turiya (4th state)                                              
      • Recognize you ARE Brahman                                              
                                                                              
   RESULT: You don't "see" Brahman — you REALIZE you ARE Brahman

   YET BRAHMAN IS NOT "LARGER" THAN ALL THIS                                  
   BRAHMAN IS THE SUBSTRATE IN WHICH ALL THIS APPEARS

   The movie appears ON the screen

   You cannot THINK Brahman.                                                  
   You cannot SPEAK Brahman.                                                  
   You can only BE Brahman — which you already ARE.

## 8. Why Brahman is "N+5" {#8-why-n5}

```
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                              
   THE CHOICE OF N+5 IS NOT ARBITRARY:                                        
                                                                              
   N+1: Plants (Biosphere) — Visible, tangible                                
   N+2: Earth (Planet) — Visible, but axis hidden                             
   N+3: Sun (Star) — Visible as light, structure hidden                       
   N+4: Galaxy (Mahavishnu) — Visible as "constants"                          
   N+5: Brahman — INVISIBLE (Ratio 0)                                         
                                                                              
   At N+5, the Dharma-Pada ratio hits ZERO                                    
   This is the rendering LIMIT from any given level                           
                                                                              
   Beyond N+5: Meaningless to Human perception                                
   There may be more levels, but we cannot even INFER them                    
                                                                              
   THE VEDAS STOP AT BRAHMAN because:                                         
   Brahman IS the substrate of the Vedas themselves                           
   The map cannot map the paper it's drawn on
