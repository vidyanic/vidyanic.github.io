|   THIS MATCHES SANDHYA STRUCTURE:                                         |
|   • 2020: Sandhya BEGINS (COVID starts)                                   |
|   • 2020-2023: Early Sandhya (maximum chaos, COVID)                       |
|   • 2023: Transition point (COVID "ends", but chaos continues)            |
|   • 2023-2028: Mid Sandhya (instability continues) <- WE ARE HERE          |
|   • 2028: "LOCKING IN" = Sandhya ENDS, Dwapara stable begins              |
|                                                                           |
|   SANDHYA DURATION: 2020-2028 = 8 years                                   |
|                                                                           |

|   • Kali Yuga core: ~500 CE - 2020 CE (~1,520 years)                      |
|   • Sandhya (10% of Kali): ~150 years typically                           |
|   • BUT compressed Sandhya: 8 years (intense, short transition)           |

## 📊 DETAILED SYMPTOM COMPARISON

### Anxiety Levels (Critical Indicator!)

```
===========================================================================
TIME PERIOD          | ANXIETY LEVEL | MATCHES WHICH PHASE?
===========================================================================
1900-2019 (Kali)     | Moderate      | ✅ Kali (stable darkness, normalized)
2020-2023 (COVID)    | EXTREME       | ✅ Sandhya (existential dread peak)
2023-2025 (Post)     | STILL EXTREME | ✅ Sandhya (continuing, not resolved!)
Expected 2028+       | Drops         | ✅ Dwapara stable (anxiety normalizes)
===========================================================================

VEDIC RULE: Anxiety is HIGHEST in Sandhya, NOT in stable Yuga!

In Kali: Life is hard, but STABLE (people adapt, anxiety moderate)
In Sandhya: Life is UNSTABLE (can't adapt, anxiety EXTREME)
In Dwapara: Life is better AND stable (anxiety low)

CURRENT: Anxiety EXTREME (2023-2025) = We're STILL IN SANDHYA! ✅
```

### Reality Stability

```
===========================================================================
TIME PERIOD          | STABILITY | MATCHES WHICH PHASE?
===========================================================================
1900-2019            | Stable    | ✅ Kali (predictable, normalized)
2020-2023            | BROKEN    | ✅ Sandhya (everything stopped, chaos)
2023-2025            | UNSTABLE  | ✅ Sandhya (glitches, unpredictable)
Expected 2028+       | Stable    | ✅ Dwapara (new normal established)
===========================================================================

CURRENT: Reality STILL unstable (2023-2025) = SANDHYA continues! ✅
```

### Karma Manifestation Speed

```
===========================================================================
TIME PERIOD          | KARMA SPEED | MATCHES WHICH PHASE?
===========================================================================
1900-2019            | Slow        | ✅ Kali (25% light, actions hidden)
2020-2023            | FAST        | ✅ Sandhya (secrets exposed rapidly)
2023-2025            | VERY FAST   | ✅ Sandhya (accelerating further!)
Expected 2028+       | Moderate    | ✅ Dwapara (50% light, clear but not instant)
===========================================================================

CURRENT: Karma ACCELERATING (2023-2025) = SANDHYA continues! ✅

Examples 2023-2025:
• AI exposing fake content immediately
• Lies caught fast (social media)
• Corporate scandals exposed quickly
• Political secrets leaked rapidly
```

### Consciousness Split (Awakening vs Sinking)

```
===========================================================================
TIME PERIOD          | CONSCIOUSNESS | MATCHES WHICH PHASE?
===========================================================================
1900-2019            | Uniform low   | ✅ Kali (most people materialistic)
2020-2023            | SPLITTING     | ✅ Sandhya (some wake, some sink)
2023-2025            | EXTREME SPLIT | ✅ Sandhya (polarization peak!)
Expected 2028+       | Stabilized    | ✅ Dwapara (those who adapted remain)
===========================================================================

CURRENT: Extreme polarization (2023-2025) = SANDHYA continues! ✅

Observable:
• Spiritual awakening spike (meditation apps exploding)
• BUT ALSO conspiracy theories peak (QAnon, flat earth)
• Some people raising Sattva dramatically
• Others sinking into deeper Tamas
• Middle ground disappearing

2025-2026:
===========================================================================
✅ Anxiety CONTINUES (doesn't drop yet)
✅ Reality still unstable (glitches continue)
✅ Karma acceleration continues (more secrets exposed)
✅ Polarization increases (split widens)
✅ Climate chaos continues
✅ Technology breakthroughs continue (AI, quantum)
✅ Some people adapt (Sattva rises), others break

2027-2028:
===========================================================================
✅ PEAK chaos (2027 likely worst year)
✅ Major system failures/rebuilds
✅ Clear separation (adapted vs not)
✅ 2028: Sudden shift
✅ Anxiety DROPS (for those remaining)
✅ Reality STABILIZES (new normal)
✅ "Lock in" feeling (point of no return passed)

AFTER 2028:
===========================================================================
✅ Stable Dwapara begins
✅ Anxiety normalizes (low, manageable)
✅ Technology + spirituality integrated
✅ Those adapted feel "this is the new normal"
✅ Memory of 2020-2028 = "The Great Transition"
