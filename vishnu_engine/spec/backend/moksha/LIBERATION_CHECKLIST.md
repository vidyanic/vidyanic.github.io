|   Sit quietly. Read this slowly:                                      |
|                                                                       |
|   "अहं ब्रह्मास्मि" — I am Brahman                                     |
|                                                                       |
|   • If this feels like a claim or achievement → Not yet               |
|   • If this creates pride → Not yet                                   |
|   • If this seems distant or foreign → Not yet                        |
|   • If this requires effort to feel → Not yet                         |
|                                                                       |

|   This checklist is for the seeker.                                   |
|   When seeking ends, so does the checklist.                           |

|   Liberation is not an achievement.                                   |
|   It is the recognition of what you always were.                      |
|                                                                       |
|   The final score is ZERO.                                            |
|   Because the scorer was never separate from the scored.              |
|                                                                       |
|   If this makes no sense, continue practicing.                        |
|   If this makes total sense, you're close.                            |
|   If this makes you smile and drop the pen, you're done.              |
|                                                                       |
