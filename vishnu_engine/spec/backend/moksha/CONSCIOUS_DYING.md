|   THE PROBLEM:                                                        |
|   =============                                                       |
|                                                                       |
|   Most people die:                                                    |
|   • In fear and confusion                                             |
|   • Identified with the body                                          |
|   • Clinging to possessions and relationships                         |
|   • Without knowing where they're going                               |
|   • With consciousness pulled by strongest Vasana                     |
|                                                                       |
|   Result:                                                             |
|   • Rebirth determined by Karma + final thought                       |
|   • No conscious choice of next destination                           |
|   • Cycle continues                                                   |
|                                                                       |

|   THE SOLUTION:                                                       |
|   ==============                                                      |
|                                                                       |
|   A yogic death:                                                      |
|   • In peace and awareness                                            |
|   • Knowing "I am not the body"                                       |
|   • Released from attachments                                         |
|   • Conscious exit through crown chakra                               |
|   • Final thought on Brahman/Ishvara                                  |
|                                                                       |
|   Result:                                                             |
|   • Higher Loka attainment OR                                         |
|   • Moksha (no rebirth) if prepared                                   |
|   • Conscious transition to next state                                |
|                                                                       |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

### The Logic

```
जीवन्मुक्ति BEFORE विदेह-मुक्ति
(Liberation while living) BEFORE (Liberation at death)

If you have not practiced dying:
• The final moment will catch you unprepared
• Habits of a lifetime will dominate
• Fear will arise

If you have practiced dying:
• Death is familiar, not frightening
• You know the route
• You have rehearsed the exit
• Consciousness remains stable

### The Crucial Moment

```
THE FINAL THOUGHT DETERMINES DESTINATION:
=========================================

Whatever Vasana is strongest at death:
-> THAT determines the next birth

"अन्तकाले च मामेव स्मरन्मुक्त्वा कलेवरम्।
यः प्रयाति स मद्भावं याति"

"He who departs thinking of Me alone at the time of leaving the body
attains My nature."

THEREFORE:
• Practice thinking of Brahman/Ishvara NOW
• So that at death, it is natural
• The mind will go where it is trained to go
```

## 3. Daily Death Meditation {#3-daily}

### Maranasati Practice (मरणस्मृति)

```
TIME: Evening, before sleep (10-15 minutes)
PLACE: Quiet, dark room
POSITION: Lying on back (like a corpse)

STEP 1: RELAXATION (2 min)
--------------------------
• Lie in Shavasana (corpse pose)
• Let all muscles release
• Breathe naturally
• Imagine body becoming heavy

STEP 2: ELEMENT DISSOLUTION VISUALIZATION (5 min)
-------------------------------------------------
Imagine each element dissolving:

EARTH:
"The solid parts of my body — bones, muscles — are dissolving.
I feel heavy, sinking into the earth.
Earth returns to earth."

WATER:
"The fluids in my body — blood, saliva — are drying up.
I feel thirsty, parched.
Water returns to water."

FIRE:
"The warmth in my body is withdrawing.
Feet become cold, then legs, then hands.
Fire returns to fire."

AIR:
"My breath becomes shallow, irregular.
Long gaps between breaths.
The last breath comes... and goes.
Air returns to air."

SPACE:
"All sensation disappears.
No sight, no sound, no touch.
Only awareness remains.
Space dissolves into awareness."

STEP 3: WITNESS RECOGNITION (3 min)
-----------------------------------
"The body has dissolved.
The elements have returned.
Yet I AM still here.
Who is this 'I' that remains?
This awareness that watched the dissolution?
THIS is what I truly am.
THIS never dies.
THIS is Atman."

STEP 4: CROWN EXIT VISUALIZATION (2 min)
----------------------------------------
"I gather my awareness at the heart.
I draw it upward through the Sushumna.
It rises to the crown — the Brahma-Randhra.
Light awaits above.
I am ready to exit through the crown.
I am consciousness, not the body."

STEP 5: RETURN (2 min)
----------------------
"For now, I return to this body.
But I have practiced.
When the actual moment comes, I will know.
I will exit consciously.
I am not afraid of death.
Death is just a doorway.
I am the deathless awareness."

Slowly wiggle fingers and toes.
Take three deep breaths.
Open eyes.
```

### Weekly Intensive Practice

```
ONCE A WEEK: Full Corpse Meditation (30 min)
============================================

1. Lie in complete stillness for 20 minutes
2. Practice "I am dead" — no movement at all
3. Observe body sensations fade
4. Identify with the witness, not the body
5. At end, "resurrect" — recognize you were never dead
```

ॐ त्र्यम्बकं यजामहे
सुगन्धिं पुष्टिवर्धनम्।
उर्वारुकमिव बन्धनान्
मृत्योर्मुक्षीय मामृतात्॥

OM TRYAMBAKAM YAJAMAHE
SUGANDHIM PUSHTI-VARDHANAM
URVARUKAM IVA BANDHANAN
MRITYOR MUKSHIYA MA-AMRITAT

MEANING:
--------
"We worship the three-eyed One (Shiva)
Who is fragrant and nourishes all beings.
Like a cucumber (naturally) released from its stem,
May we be liberated from death, not from immortality."

THE KEY INSIGHT:
----------------
"Mrityor mukshiya" = Liberate from death
"Ma amritat" = NOT from immortality

We ask to be freed from the FEAR of death,
Not from our DEATHLESS nature.
We ARE already immortal.
We ask only to REMEMBER this at death.
```

   • DO NOT engage with fear, people, memories
   • One-pointed focus on exit

5. PRANA DIRECTION

   • Visualize light at Brahma-Randhra
   • Exit through the crown
```

### The Yogic Death

```
THE IDEAL DEATH:
================

• Awareness remains clear throughout dissolution

• Merge into Light / Brahman / Ishvara

SIGNS OF SUCCESSFUL YOGIC DEATH:
================================
• Face remains peaceful
• Body stays warm at crown for some time
• Pleasant fragrance may arise
• Those present feel peace
• No struggle at end
```

### The Final Mantra

```
WHATEVER YOUR TRADITION, HAVE ONE FINAL MANTRA:
===============================================

Generic: ॐ (OM)
Vedantic: ॐ तत् सत् (Om Tat Sat)
Shaiva: ॐ नमः शिवाय (Om Namah Shivaya)
Vaishnava: ॐ नमो नारायणाय (Om Namo Narayanaya)
Krishna Bhakti: हरे कृष्ण (Hare Krishna)
Rama Bhakti: राम राम राम (Ram Ram Ram)
Devi: ॐ दुं दुर्गायै नमः (Om Dum Durgayai Namah)

WHAT MATTERS:
• That you have practiced it for years
• That it arises spontaneously
• That it is on your lips/mind at the end
• It will guide you to the corresponding Loka or liberation
```

## 7. After Death (For Loved Ones) {#7-after}

### Immediately After Death

```
FOR THOSE PRESENT:

   • Don't move, don't close eyes immediately
   • Consciousness may still be exiting

3. MAINTAIN PEACEFUL ATMOSPHERE
   • No loud crying or wailing

   • Light incense, keep lamp lit

4. CHANT TRANSIT MANTRAS
   • "ॐ नमो नारायणाय — Go to the Light"

```

### The Antyeshti (Final Rites)

```
PURPOSE OF LAST RITES:
======================
• Help Jiva detach from physical body
• Burn Samskaras stored in body
• Provide energy for journey
• Give closure to living

KEY RITUALS:
============

   • Clears ongoing Rina
```

### For Your Own Death

```
INSTRUCTIONS TO LEAVE FOR YOUR FAMILY:

"When I die:
1. Chant ॐ नमः शिवाय (or your mantra) near my body
2. Keep the room peaceful — no loud crying
3. Leave my body undisturbed for at least 3 hours
4. Cremate according to tradition
5. Do not grieve excessively — I am not gone
6. I am the awareness that never dies
7. We will meet again, or I will be free
