## ❓ Questions This Section Answers

- Why does looking at a particle change it?
- Why can't we know position AND momentum perfectly?
- How can particles be connected across the universe instantly?
- Why does everything fall apart (entropy)?
- What is gravity really?
- Does the universe have a "resolution limit"?

## 💡 The Key Insight

**Physics describes the "frontend" — what we measure.**
**Vedas describe the "backend" — how it actually works.**

```
PHYSICS (Measures)     ↔     VEDAS (Explains)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━        ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Entropy increases      ←     Tamas grows
Observation collapses  ←     Sankalpa manifests
Particles entangled    ←     Indra's Net connects
Gravity attracts       ←     Tamas pulls together
```
