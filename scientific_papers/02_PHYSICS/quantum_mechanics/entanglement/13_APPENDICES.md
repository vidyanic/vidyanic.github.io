## Appendix A: Bell Inequality

```
BELL'S INEQUALITY:
==================

|P(a,b) - P(a,c)| ≤ 1 + P(b,c)

WHERE: P(x,y) = correlation between measurements at angles x, y

QUANTUM MECHANICS VIOLATES THIS:
Maximum violation: 2√2 ≈ 2.83 (Tsirelson bound)
Classical maximum: 2

EXPERIMENTS SHOW: ~2.83 (QM prediction correct)
```
