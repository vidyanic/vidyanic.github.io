## 3.1 The Non-Locality Model

```
ENTANGLEMENT LOGIC:
====================

BEFORE MEASUREMENT:
Both particles in superposition
State is correlated (entangled)
Neither has definite property

MEASUREMENT (Particle A):
A collapses to definite state
B INSTANTLY has correlated state
No signal traveled

EXPLANATION:
They were never separate
"Two" is appearance
One state, two views
```

## 3.2 Multi-Persona Explanation

<summary><b>🤖 For AI/ML Engineers</b></summary>

```python
class EntangledPair:
    def __init__(self):
        # Single shared state, two access points
        self._shared_state = Superposition()
        
    def measure_A(self):
        result = self._shared_state.collapse()
        return result
        
    def measure_B(self):
        # Same shared state -> correlated result
        return self._shared_state.get_correlated()

# Not two objects communicating — one object with two names
```

Imagine breaking a cookie in half:
- You send halves to opposite sides of universe
- When someone opens one box, they KNOW what's in the other
- No signal needed — the correlation was there from the start

But quantum is stranger:
- Before opening, both halves are "both shapes at once"
- Opening one determines BOTH
- They were never really separate

## 3.3 Indra's Net Framework

```
ALL JEWELS ARE ONE NET:
======================

• Apparent separation = Maya
• True nature = Non-dual (Advaita)
• Particles "feel" connected because they ARE connected
• Distance is illusion in underlying reality
```
