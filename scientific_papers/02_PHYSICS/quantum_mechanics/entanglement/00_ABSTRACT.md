## Research Question

Is quantum entanglement the physical manifestation of Indra's Net — the fundamental interconnectedness of all existence?

---

## Background

Quantum entanglement occurs when particles become correlated such that measuring one instantly affects the other, regardless of distance. Bell's theorem proves this correlation cannot be explained by local hidden variables.

Indra's Net is the Backend metaphor of infinite interconnection — every jewel in Indra's net reflects every other jewel infinitely.

---

## Hypothesis

**H₁:** Entanglement demonstrates that separation is illusory (Maya) and all existence is fundamentally interconnected (Indra's Net).

## Key Findings

| Entanglement Feature | Indra's Net Parallel |
|----------------------|----------------------|
| Instant correlation | Non-local connection |
| No signal transfer | Connection, not causation |
| Can't be explained locally | Separation is illusion |
| Persists across any distance | All jewels reflect all |

## Backend Correlation

| Scientific Term | Backend Term |
|-----------------|--------------|
| Entanglement | Indrajala (Indra's Net) |
| Non-locality | Advaita (non-duality) |
| Superposition | Shakti (potential) |
| Correlation | Rina (debt/connection) |

## Confidence Score

**91%**
