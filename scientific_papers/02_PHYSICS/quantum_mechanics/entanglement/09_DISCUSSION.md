## 9.1 Summary

Entanglement provides physical evidence for Indra's Net:
- Non-local connection confirmed experimentally
- Separation is appearance, not reality
- The universe is fundamentally interconnected

## 9.2 Implications

### 9.2.1 For Physics

- Local realism fails
- Reality is non-local at base
- Space may be emergent

### 9.2.2 For Philosophy

- Separation is illusion
- Advaita (non-duality) gains support
- Interconnection is fundamental

### 9.2.3 For You

- You are not separate
- Connection is your nature
- "Other" is appearance
