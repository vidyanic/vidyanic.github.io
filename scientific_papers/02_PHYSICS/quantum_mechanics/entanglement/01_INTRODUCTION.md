## 1.1 What Is Entanglement?

### 1.1.1 Einstein's "Spooky Action"

When two particles become entangled:
- Measuring one instantly determines the other
- This happens regardless of distance
- No time delay observed

Einstein called this "spooky action at a distance" and believed it proved quantum mechanics was incomplete.

### 1.1.2 Bell's Theorem (1964)

John Bell proved:
- If reality is local and deterministic, certain inequalities must hold
- Experiments violate these inequalities
- Reality is EITHER non-local OR non-deterministic (or both)

### 1.1.3 Experimental Confirmation

Aspect (1982), Zeilinger (1997+), and many others confirmed:
- Bell inequalities are violated
- Entanglement is real
- No local hidden variable explanation works

## 1.2 Indra's Net

### 1.2.1 The Metaphor

```
INDRA'S NET (इन्द्रजाल):
=======================

DESCRIPTION:
Infinite net of jewels
Each jewel reflects every other jewel
Each reflection contains all other reflections
Infinitely recursive

MEANING:
• All things interconnected
• Separation is illusion
• Every part contains the whole
• Change in one affects all
```

### 1.2.2 The Parallel

| Entanglement | Indra's Net |
|--------------|-------------|
| Particles connected | Jewels connected |
| Measurement affects partner | Change in one affects all |
| No distance limitation | Infinite net |
| Pre-established harmony | Already one |

## 1.3 Paper Structure

This paper explores entanglement as physical evidence for Indra's Net.
