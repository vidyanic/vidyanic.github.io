# 6. Results

## 6.1 Double-Slit Experiment Results

### 6.1.1 Standard Double-Slit

**Setup:** Single electrons/photons fired at double slit

| Condition | Which-Path Known? | Result |
|-----------|-------------------|--------|
| No detector | No | Interference pattern |
| Detector present | Yes | Particle pattern |
| Detector present, not observed | No (not accessed) | Interference |

**Key Finding:**
It's not the detector that matters — it's whether which-path information is **available to consciousness**.

### 6.1.2 Single Particle Buildup

From Tonomura et al. (1989):

```
OBSERVATION:
Single electrons, one at a time
Each electron → Single dot on screen
After 70,000 electrons → Interference pattern emerges

IMPLICATION:
Each single electron "knew" where to land to form pattern
As if interfering with itself
Wave nature is real, not statistical
```

### 6.1.3 Which-Path Detection Effects

| Detection Method | Pattern Result | Information Available? |
|------------------|----------------|----------------------|
| None | Interference | No |
| Weak measurement | Partial | Partial |
| Strong measurement | Particle | Yes |
| Measurement + erasure | Interference | No (erased) |

**Conclusion:**
The variable is **information availability**, not physical interaction.

## 6.2 Delayed Choice Quantum Eraser Results

### 6.2.1 Kim et al. (2000) Experiment

**Setup:**
1. Entangled photon pairs created
2. Signal photon → Screen (position recorded)
3. Idler photon → Delayed choice detector
4. Choice to preserve or erase which-path made AFTER signal photon arrives

**Results:**

| Idler Treatment | Signal Pattern | Timeline |
|-----------------|----------------|----------|
| Path preserved | Particle | Decision after arrival |
| Path erased | Interference | Decision after arrival |

**Key Finding:**
Future choice of preservation/erasure affects PAST pattern on screen.

### 6.2.2 Retrocausal Implication

```
TIMELINE:
t=0: Signal photon created
t=1: Signal photon hits screen
t=2: Idler photon reaches detector
t=3: Choice made to preserve/erase

YET:
Pattern at t=1 depends on choice at t=3!

INTERPRETATION:
Either: Retrocausality is real
Or: The pattern doesn't "exist" until consciously observed (later)

BACKEND VIEW:
Consciousness is outside linear time
Past is not fixed until observed
```

### 6.2.3 Subcorrelation Analysis

When total screen data analyzed:
- No interference pattern visible
- Pattern only emerges when sorted by idler result
- Information from "future" reveals "past" pattern

## 6.3 Heisenberg Cut Analysis Results

### 6.3.1 Where Is the Cut?

**Von Neumann Chain:**

```
Particle → Detector → Recording → Brain → ???

QUESTION: Where does quantum become classical?

ATTEMPT 1: At detector
PROBLEM: Detector is also quantum

ATTEMPT 2: At recording
PROBLEM: Recording can be erased (quantum eraser)

ATTEMPT 3: At brain
PROBLEM: Brain is also atoms/molecules

ATTEMPT 4: At consciousness
RESULT: No further chain — consciousness is endpoint
```

### 6.3.2 Cut Movement Experiments

| Cut Position | Experiment Shows | Result |
|--------------|------------------|--------|
| At detector | Delayed choice | Cut must move |
| At environment | Decoherence | Apparent, not actual |
| At brain | Neural quantum effects | Still quantum |
| At consciousness | No contradiction | Consistent |

**Conclusion:**
The Heisenberg cut cannot be physically placed. Only consciousness provides a consistent boundary.

### 6.3.3 Infinite Regress Problem

```
IF cut is at detector:
→ What observes detector?
→ Another detector?
→ What observes that?
→ Infinite regress!

ONLY SOLUTION:
Consciousness is NOT part of the physical chain
It observes FROM OUTSIDE
(Matches Backend: Drashta is not part of Drishya)
```

## 6.4 Wigner's Friend Results

### 6.4.1 The Paradox

**Scenario:**
1. Friend in lab measures particle, sees |0⟩
2. Wigner outside describes: (Friend+Particle) in superposition
3. Who is "right"?

**Analysis:**

| Observer | Description | Valid? |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| Friend | Definite result |0⟩ | Yes (from their view) |
| Wigner | Superposition | Yes (from their view) |
| Both? | Contradiction! | ??? |

### 6.4.2 Frauchiger-Renner Extension (2018)

**Result:**
If quantum mechanics applies universally AND observers can describe each other, logical contradictions arise.

**Paper Conclusion:**
"Quantum theory cannot consistently describe the use of itself."

### 6.4.3 Resolution with Consciousness

```
RESOLUTION:
Each conscious observer has their own "branch"
Collapse is relative to observer
No absolute collapse — only observed collapse

BACKEND EQUIVALENT:
Each Drashta has their own Drishya
Reality is observer-relative
No objective reality independent of consciousness
```

| H2 (Cut undefined) | All cut experiments | None |
| H3 (Retrocausal) | Delayed choice | None |
| H4 (Backend match) | All experiments | None |
| H₀ (Consciousness fundamental) | All above | None |

## 6.6 Pattern Recognition

### 6.6.1 Common Thread

All experiments show:

```
PATTERN:
1. Physical interaction alone → Superposition persists
2. Information availability to consciousness → Collapse occurs
3. Information erasure → Superposition restored
4. Timing of conscious observation → Determines past pattern

CONCLUSION:
Consciousness is the irreducible variable.
```

### 6.6.2 Backend Pattern Match

| Experiment | Backend Prediction | Match? |
|------------|-------------------|--------|
| Double-slit | Observation manifests | ✓ |
| Delayed choice | Time is Maya | ✓ |
| Quantum eraser | Knowledge determines | ✓ |
| Wigner's friend | Drashta-relative | ✓ |
| Heisenberg cut | Drashta outside chain | ✓ |

**All predictions confirmed.**
