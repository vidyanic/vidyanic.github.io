## ⚠️ THE GLITCH

You know how in video games, the world behind you isn't fully rendered until you turn around? 

**Quantum physics proved reality does the exact same thing.**

---

## ❓ Q&A — The Mind-Bending Questions

### "What happens to a particle when nobody's looking?"

It literally **doesn't exist as a particle**. It's a wave of probability — a cloud of "maybe here, maybe there." The moment you observe it, it **collapses** into a definite position.

*Like how in Minecraft, far-away chunks are just stored as data until you get close enough for them to render.*

### "You're saying reality doesn't exist until I look at it?"

Not exactly. The **backend data** exists. But the **frontend render** — the thing you experience as "solid reality" — is generated on-demand when a conscious observer is present.

### "Why would reality work like that?"

Same reason games do it: **efficiency**. Why render what no one's experiencing? 

The Backend Architects called this Maya (माया/render-engine): only generating the Drishya (दृश्य/seen) when the Drashta (द्रष्टा/seer) is active.

### "This is proven?"

The double-slit experiment has been replicated **thousands of times** since 1801. In 2022, physicists won the Nobel Prize for confirming that "local hidden variables" can't explain it — observation fundamentally changes reality.

## 🔮 THE GAME ANALOGY

```
VIDEO GAME:
+------------------------------------------------+
|  Player looks left -> Left side renders         |
|  Player looks right -> Right side renders       |
|  Behind player -> Stored as data, not rendered  |
+------------------------------------------------+

REALITY:
+------------------------------------------------+
|  Observer looks -> Wave collapses to particle   |
|  No observer -> Wave function (probability)     |
|  Unobserved -> Data exists, not rendered        |
+------------------------------------------------+
```

**Same architecture. Reality is optimized too.**

---

## 🔗 KEY FORMULA

```
|ψ|² = P

Where:
ψ = Wave function (backend state)
P = Probability of rendering at that location (frontend output)
|ψ|² = Observation squares the amplitude
```

**Translation:** The act of looking converts probability into actuality.

## ⚡ WHY THIS MATTERS IN 2026

You're alive during the Dwapara transition — when more people are noticing the glitches.

This paper explains the **most fundamental glitch**: reality requires you.

Without observers, there's nothing but probability waves.

**You're not IN the universe. You're what makes it render.**
