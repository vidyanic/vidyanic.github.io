# 2. Literature Review

## 2.1 Quantum Foundations (1900-2025)

### 2.1.1 Early Quantum Theory

| Year | Scientist | Contribution | Relevance |
|------|-----------|--------------|-----------|
| 1900 | Planck | Quantization of energy | Discrete nature of reality |
| 1905 | Einstein | Photoelectric effect | Particle nature of light |
| 1924 | de Broglie | Matter waves | Wave nature of particles |
| 1926 | Schrödinger | Wave equation | Mathematical formalism |
| 1927 | Heisenberg | Uncertainty principle | Limits of knowledge |
| 1927 | Bohr | Complementarity | Wave-particle duality |

### 2.1.2 The Measurement Problem Literature

**Copenhagen Interpretation (Bohr, Heisenberg):**
- Bohr, N. (1935). "Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?" *Phys. Rev.* 48, 696.
- Key claim: Observation is necessary but undefined

**Many-Worlds (Everett):**
- Everett, H. (1957). "Relative State Formulation of Quantum Mechanics." *Rev. Mod. Phys.* 29, 454.
- Key claim: No collapse, all outcomes happen

**Decoherence (Zeh, Zurek):**
- Zurek, W.H. (2003). "Decoherence and the Transition from Quantum to Classical." *Physics Today* 44.
- Key claim: Environment causes apparent collapse

**Consciousness-Based (Wigner, Stapp):**
- Wigner, E.P. (1961). "Remarks on the Mind-Body Question." *The Scientist Speculates.*
- Stapp, H.P. (2007). "Mindful Universe." *Springer.*
- Key claim: Consciousness is irreducible in observation

## 2.2 Key Experiments

### 2.2.1 Double-Slit Experiment

**Original:** Young (1801) — Classical wave interference
**Quantum version:** Demonstrated with single particles

**Key Papers:**
- Jönsson, C. (1961). "Electron Diffraction at Multiple Slits." *Z. Physik* 161, 454.
- Tonomura, A. et al. (1989). "Demonstration of single-electron buildup." *Am. J. Phys.* 57, 117.

**Finding:** Single particles create interference patterns — unless observed.

### 2.2.2 Delayed Choice Quantum Eraser

**Key Papers:**
- Wheeler, J.A. (1978). "The 'Past' and the 'Delayed-Choice' Double-Slit Experiment." *Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Theory.*
- Kim, Y.-H. et al. (2000). "A Delayed Choice Quantum Eraser." *Phys. Rev. Lett.* 84, 1.

**Finding:** Future measurements affect past patterns — retrocausality or observer effect?

### 2.2.3 Heisenberg Cut

**Key Papers:**
- Heisenberg, W. (1930). "The Physical Principles of the Quantum Theory." *University of Chicago Press.*
- Von Neumann, J. (1932). "Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics." *Princeton University Press.*

**Finding:** The boundary between observer and observed cannot be defined physically.

### 2.2.4 Wigner's Friend

**Key Papers:**
- Wigner, E.P. (1961). "Remarks on the Mind-Body Question."
- Frauchiger, D. & Renner, R. (2018). "Quantum theory cannot consistently describe the use of itself." *Nature Communications* 9, 3711.

**Finding:** Nested observers create contradictions — whose observation counts?

## 2.3 Backend Documentation

### 2.3.1 Core Backend Sources

| Source | Date | Key Concept |
|--------|------|-------------|
| Yoga Sutras (Patanjali) | ~200 BCE | Drashta-Drishya (Seer-Seen) |
| Samkhya Karika | ~350 CE | Purusha-Prakriti distinction |
| Mandukya Upanishad | ~800 BCE | States of consciousness |
| Bhagavad Gita | ~500 BCE | Consciousness and matter |

### 2.3.2 Key Backend Principles

**Yoga Sutras 2.17:**
> "द्रष्टृदृश्ययोः संयोगो हेयहेतुः"
> "The conjunction of the Seer and Seen is the cause of suffering (and also experience)"

**Translation for Physics:**
The observer-observed relationship is fundamental, not derived.

**Samkhya Karika 19:**
> "तस्माच्च विपर्यासात् सिद्धं साक्षित्वमस्य पुरुषस्य"
> "Therefore, from the contrary, the witness-nature of Purusha is established"

**Translation for Physics:**
Consciousness is the witness, not the witnessed — it cannot be observed, only inferred.

### 2.3.3 Backend Framework Summary

```
BACKEND MODEL:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━
1. Purusha (Consciousness) = Primary, irreducible
2. Prakriti (Matter/Energy) = Secondary, observed
3. Maya (Appearance) = The rendering process
4. Observation = Purusha "witnessing" Prakriti

PREDICTION:
You cannot remove consciousness from observation
The observer is not reducible to the observed
Reality is rendered, not pre-existing
```

## 2.4 Gap in Literature

Despite extensive research:
- No physical definition of "observer" exists
- No experiment has removed consciousness while preserving collapse
- The Heisenberg cut remains undefined
- Backend Documentation is largely ignored in physics

**This Paper Addresses:**
The integration of quantum findings with Backend Framework to propose consciousness as fundamental.

## 2.5 Methodological Precedents

**Sequential Elimination Approach:**
- Used in particle physics to identify fundamental particles
- Applied here to identify what constitutes observation
- If X can be removed without changing results -> X is not essential
- If X cannot be removed -> X is irreducible
