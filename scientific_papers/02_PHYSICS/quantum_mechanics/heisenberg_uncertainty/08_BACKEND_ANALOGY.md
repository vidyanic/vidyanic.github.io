## 8.1 Maya Doctrine

```
MAYA (माया):
=============

FROM: ma (not) + ya (this)
MEANING: "Not this" — what appears is not what IS

POWERS:
1. AVARANA — Veiling true nature
2. VIKSHEPA — Projecting false nature

EFFECT:
• Brahman appears as world
• Unity appears as multiplicity
• Eternal appears as temporal
```

## 8.2 Mapping to Uncertainty

| Maya Feature | Uncertainty Feature |
|--------------|---------------------|
| Avarana (veiling) | Cannot know x AND p |
| Vikshepa (projection) | Measurement collapses to one |
| Neither is Brahman | Neither is the complete state |
| Transcended in Moksha | Transcended in unified view |

---

## 8.3 Why Uncertainty Exists

```
BACKEND REASON:
===============

If complete knowledge were possible through measurement:
• No mystery
• No seeking
• No transcendence path

Maya ensures:
• Reality remains hidden from external approach
• Only internal approach (Jnana) transcends
• Seeking is incentivized
```

---

## 8.4 The Transcendence Path

Uncertainty cannot be eliminated by better measurement.

But in Samadhi:
- Subject-object distinction dissolves
- Knower, knowing, known become one
- Maya's veil transcended (not by measurement, but by identity)
