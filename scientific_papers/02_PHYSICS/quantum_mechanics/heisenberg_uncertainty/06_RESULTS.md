## 6.1 Structural Match

| Uncertainty | Maya | Match |
|-------------|------|-------|
| Fundamental limit | Inherent veiling | ✓ |
| Complementary pairs | Dual aspects | ✓ |
| Not eliminable | Design feature | ✓ |
| Observation collapses | Vikshepa projects | ✓ |

## 6.2 Mathematical Parallel

```
UNCERTAINTY: Δx × Δp ≥ ℏ/2
MAYA: Complete_Knowledge × Manifestation = Limited

The product of complementary "knowings" is bounded.
```

## 6.3 Experiments Confirm

All experiments confirm uncertainty as fundamental:
- Single-slit diffraction
- Heisenberg microscope gedanken
- Modern weak measurement (still bounded)
