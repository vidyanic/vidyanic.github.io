## Research Question

Is the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle a manifestation of Maya (the veiling power) at the quantum level?

---

## Background

The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states:
```
Δx × Δp ≥ ℏ/2
```
You cannot simultaneously know both position (x) and momentum (p) with arbitrary precision.

This is NOT a measurement limitation — the particle genuinely doesn't possess definite values until observed.

---

## Hypothesis

**H₁:** Uncertainty is Maya operating at the quantum level — the fundamental veiling that prevents complete knowledge through measurement.

---

## Key Findings

| Uncertainty Feature | Maya Parallel |
|---------------------|---------------|
| Cannot know both x and p | Cannot see Brahman through one perspective |
| Not measurement error | Not ignorance — inherent veiling |
| Complementary pairs | Saguna aspects (each veils the other) |
| Transcendable (in principle) | Maya transcended in Moksha |

---

## Backend Correlation

| Scientific Term | Backend Term |
|-----------------|--------------|
| Uncertainty | Maya-Avarana (veiling) |
| Complementarity | Saguna duality |
| Wave function | Potentiality (Shakti) |
| Measurement | Observation (Darshan) |
| Collapse | Maya-Vikshepа (projection) |

## Confidence Score
