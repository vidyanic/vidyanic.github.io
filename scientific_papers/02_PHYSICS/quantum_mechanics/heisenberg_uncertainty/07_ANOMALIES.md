# 7. Anomalies

## 7.1 Weak Measurement

### 7.1.1 The Phenomenon

"Weak measurements" seem to extract more information than uncertainty allows.

### 7.1.2 Resolution

Statistical, not single-shot. Overall uncertainty preserved.

---

## 7.2 Squeezed States

### 7.2.1 The Phenomenon

One variable's uncertainty can be reduced below normal limits.

### 7.2.2 Resolution

The complementary variable's uncertainty increases proportionally. Total bound preserved.

## 7.3 Zero-Point Energy

Even at absolute zero, quantum systems have minimum energy — uncertainty ensures minimum action.

**Backend:** Even in "rest" (Pralaya), Shakti retains minimum vibration.
