# 9. Discussion

## 9.1 Summary

Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle matches Maya's veiling function:
- Both are fundamental, not technical limitations
- Both involve complementary aspects
- Both ensure reality cannot be fully captured externally
- Both point to a transcendent approach

## 9.2 Implications

### 9.2.1 For Physics

- Uncertainty is designed, not deficient
- Complete knowledge requires different approach
- Measurement inherently limits

### 9.2.2 For Philosophy

- Reality has privacy
- External approach bounded
- Internal approach (consciousness) needed

## 9.3 Connection to Other Papers

| Paper | Connection |
|-------|------------|
| Observer Effect | Observation collapses = Vikshepa |
| Entanglement | Connection beyond measurement |
| Hard Problem | External approach fails for consciousness too |
