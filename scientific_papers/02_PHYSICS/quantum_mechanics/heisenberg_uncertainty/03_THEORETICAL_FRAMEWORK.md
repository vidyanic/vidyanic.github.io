## 3.1 Maya's Two Powers

```
MAYA = AVARANA + VIKSHEPA
══════════════════════════

AVARANA (Veiling):
• Hides the true nature
• Creates "not knowing"
• Uncertainty IS this veiling

VIKSHEPA (Projection):
• Projects apparent reality
• Creates "false knowing"
• Wave function collapse IS this projection
```

## 3.2 Multi-Persona Explanation

<summary><b>🤖 For AI/ML Engineers</b></summary>

```python
class Particle:
    def __init__(self):
        self.state = "superposition"
        # Cannot access both precisely
        self._position_precision = infinity
        self._momentum_precision = infinity
        
    def measure_position(self, precision):
        # Measuring position costs momentum certainty
        self._position_precision = precision
        self._momentum_precision = h_bar / (2 * precision)
        
    # Maya = The API limitation preventing full state access
```

Imagine trying to see a coin that's both heads and tails until you look:
- Looking "collapses" it to one
- But you can never see it being both
- The "both-ness" is veiled by observation

That veiling IS Maya — the fundamental privacy of reality.

## 3.3 Uncertainty as Design Feature

Not a bug — a feature:
- Prevents complete determinism
- Enables quantum creativity
- Maintains mystery at the core
