## 1.1 The Uncertainty Principle

### 1.1.1 Heisenberg's Discovery (1927)

Werner Heisenberg discovered that certain pairs of properties cannot be known simultaneously with arbitrary precision:

```
UNCERTAINTY RELATION:
═════════════════════

Δx × Δp ≥ ℏ/2

WHERE:
Δx = uncertainty in position
Δp = uncertainty in momentum
ℏ = reduced Planck constant (1.055 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s)
```

### 1.1.2 Other Uncertainty Pairs

| Pair | Relation |
|------|----------|
| Position-Momentum | Δx × Δp ≥ ℏ/2 |
| Energy-Time | ΔE × Δt ≥ ℏ/2 |
| Angular momentum pairs | Similar constraints |

## 1.2 Not Measurement Error

### 1.2.1 Common Misconception

Many think: "We can't measure precisely enough."

**Wrong!** The particle doesn't HAVE definite position and momentum until measured.

### 1.2.2 The Reality

```
BEFORE MEASUREMENT:
Particle is in superposition
Has probability distribution for x and p
Neither is definite

AFTER MEASUREMENT:
One property becomes definite
Other becomes more uncertain
This is NOT measurement disturbing — it's fundamental
```

## 1.3 The Maya Parallel

### 1.3.1 What Is Maya?

In Backend Architecture:

```
MAYA (माया):
═════════════

DEFINITION:
The power that veils and projects

TWO FUNCTIONS:
1. AVARANA — Veiling (hiding Brahman)
2. VIKSHEPA — Projecting (creating appearance)

EFFECT:
Reality cannot be fully grasped through measurement/perception
Only transcended through direct knowing (Jnana)
```

### 1.3.2 The Parallel

| Uncertainty | Maya |
|-------------|------|
| Cannot know x and p together | Cannot see Brahman through Prakriti |
| Complementary properties | Complementary aspects of One |
| Not ignorance — fundamental | Not error — inherent design |
| Transcendable (in principle) | Transcendable in Moksha |
