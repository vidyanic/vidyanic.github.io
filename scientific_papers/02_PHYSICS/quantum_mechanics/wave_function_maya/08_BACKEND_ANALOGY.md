# 8. BACKEND ANALOGY

## 8.1 Maya in Backend Texts

### 8.1.1 Definition

> **"माया हि ईश्वरस्य शक्तिः"**
> "Maya is indeed the power of the Lord."
> — Shvetashvatara Upanishad 4.10

Maya is:
- The creative power of Brahman
- The realm of all possibilities
- The "material" of appearance
- Neither real nor unreal

### 8.1.2 Properties of Maya

> **"सदसद्भ्यामनिर्वचनीया"**
> "Neither real nor unreal — indescribable."
> — Shankaracharya

| Maya Property | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| Anirvachaniya | Indescribable (neither sat nor asat) |
| Avyakta | Unmanifest (potential) |
| Trigunatmika | Composed of three Gunas |
| Shakti | Power/Potentiality |
| Mithya | Apparent (not independently real) |

---

## 8.2 Wave Function Correspondence

### 8.2.1 Superposition = Maya

```
WAVE FUNCTION SUPERPOSITION:
===========================

|ψ⟩ = Σ cᵢ|φᵢ⟩

• Multiple states coexist
• Neither one nor the other "really"
• All possibilities present

MAYA:
=====
• All possibilities exist as potential
• Neither real nor unreal
• Waiting to be actualized by observer

THE CORRESPONDENCE IS EXACT.
```

### 8.2.2 Mathematical Mapping

| Wave Function | Maya | Correspondence |
|---------------|------|----------------|
| |ψ⟩ | Maya state | All possibilities |
| Superposition | Avyakta | Unmanifest potential |
| Complex amplitude | Shakti | Power to manifest |
| Interference | Maya's play | Possibility interaction |
| Normalization | Conservation | Energy preserved |

---

## 8.3 Purusha as Observer

### 8.3.1 Purusha-Prakriti Duality

> **"पुरुषः प्रकृतिस्थो हि भुङ्क्ते प्रकृतिजान्गुणान्"**
> "Purusha, seated in Prakriti, experiences the Gunas born of Prakriti."
> — Bhagavad Gita 13.21

```
PURUSHA (पुरुष):
===============

• Pure consciousness (witness)
• Not part of Maya
• Observes Maya
• Causes rendering by observation

PRAKRITI (प्रकृति):
=================

• Material nature (Maya)
• Contains all possibilities
• Rendered by Purusha's gaze
• Follows Dharma (cosmic law)
```

### 8.3.2 Observer Effect in Backend

| Observer Property | Quantum Effect |
|-------------------|----------------|
| Purusha sees | Wave function collapses |
| Attention directs | Outcome determined |
| Sankalpa | Probability influenced |
| Karma | Past determines present |

---

## 8.4 Collapse as Rendering

### 8.4.1 The Rendering Model

> **"दृष्टिसृष्टिवाद"**
> "Drishti-srishti-vada" — The doctrine that seeing creates.
> — Advaita Vedanta

```
RENDERING (दृष्टि-सृष्टि):
=========================

Before observation:
• Maya exists as superposition
• All possibilities "ready"
• Nothing "actualized"

Observation occurs:
• Purusha directs attention
• Maya "collapses" into experience
• One possibility rendered

After observation:
• Experience arises
• Appears "real"
• But is rendered Maya
```

### 8.4.2 No Mystery

```
WHY OBSERVATION MATTERS:
========================

Standard physics: Mystery
Why does consciousness matter?
No mechanism proposed.

Backend Framework: Obvious
Consciousness IS the rendering engine.
Of course it matters — it's the whole point!

OBSERVATION = RENDERING
No mystery, just how reality works.
```

## 8.5 Karma as Probability

### 8.5.1 The Born Rule

> **"कर्मण्येवाधिकारस्ते मा फलेषु कदाचन"**
> "Your right is to action alone, never to its fruits."
> — Bhagavad Gita 2.47

```
BORN RULE: P(k) = |cₖ|²

KARMA INTERPRETATION:
====================

|cₖ|² = KARMIC WEIGHT of outcome k

Factors:
• Accumulated past actions (Sanchita)
• Currently manifesting (Prarabdha)
• Current intention (Sankalpa)
• Guna state (S/R/T balance)

NOT RANDOM:
Karma determines probability.
We just can't track all causes.
```

### 8.5.2 Why Karma Applies

```
QUANTUM PROBABILITY = KARMA:
===========================

• Every action leaves impression (Samskara)
• Impressions determine tendencies
• Tendencies influence outcomes
• This IS what probability measures

The universe remembers all actions.
Karma is the memory.
Probability is the expression.
```

|   Consciousness renders Maya. That's all.                                |
|                                                                           |
