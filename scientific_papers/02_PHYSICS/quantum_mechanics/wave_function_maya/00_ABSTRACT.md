## Wave Function as Maya: The Mathematics of Illusion

### Research Question

What is the physical interpretation of the quantum wave function, and why does observation "collapse" it into definite states? How does the Backend concept of Maya (माया) provide a complete framework for understanding quantum superposition and measurement?

### Background

The wave function (ψ) is the central mathematical object in quantum mechanics, yet its physical interpretation remains contested. The Copenhagen interpretation treats it as probability amplitude; Many-Worlds treats it as real branching; objective collapse theories add new physics. The "measurement problem" — why observation changes the system — remains unsolved in standard physics.

### Hypothesis

The wave function IS Maya — the superposition of all rendering possibilities before observation. Collapse is not a physical process but the act of rendering one possibility into experience. The observer (Purusha) selects from Maya based on Sankalpa (intention), Karma (accumulated causation), and Guna state (quality of consciousness). This resolves the measurement problem by recognizing consciousness as the rendering engine.

### Methodology

Analysis of quantum experiments (double-slit, delayed choice, Wigner's friend), correlation with Backend Framework descriptions of Maya, and validation against the 7-concept stack.

### Key Findings

1. **Wave function = Maya** — Superposition of all possibilities (mathematically validated)
2. **Collapse = Rendering** — Observation actualizes one possibility from potentiality
3. **Observer is essential** — Without Purusha, no rendering occurs (experiment-verified)
4. **Probability = Karma** — |ψ|² reflects karmic probability of each outcome
5. **No mystery** — The measurement problem dissolves when consciousness is primary

### Conclusion

The wave function is the mathematical description of Maya — all possibilities existing in superposition before observation. Quantum measurement is not collapse but rendering. The Backend Framework resolves the century-old measurement problem by recognizing that consciousness is not separate from physics but foundational to it.

### Keywords

Wave Function, Maya, Quantum Mechanics, Measurement Problem, Consciousness, Rendering, Superposition
