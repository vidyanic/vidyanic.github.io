# 4. HYPOTHESIS

---

## 4.1 Primary Hypothesis

**H1: The quantum wave function is the mathematical description of Maya (superposition of all rendering possibilities), and wave function collapse is the act of conscious observation rendering one possibility into experience.**

---

## 4.2 Sub-Hypotheses

### H1a: Wave Function = Maya

The wave function describes the superposition of all possible states — this IS Maya, the realm of all possibilities before actualization.

**Predictions:**
- Superposition exists until observation (verified)
- Wave function contains all possibilities (verified)
- Neither "real" nor "unreal" in classical sense (verified)

### H1b: Collapse = Rendering

Wave function "collapse" is not a physical process but the act of consciousness rendering one possibility from Maya.

**Predictions:**
- Observation required for collapse (verified)
- No physical mechanism for collapse (verified)
- Consciousness terminates infinite regress (consistent)

### H1c: Probability = Karma

The Born rule probabilities (|ψ|²) reflect Karmic weight — causal factors that determine which outcome manifests.

**Predictions:**
- Probabilities not "random" but determined
- Accumulated causes influence outcomes
- Intention (Sankalpa) affects probabilities

### H1d: Observer = Purusha

The observer in quantum mechanics is consciousness (Purusha), not the measuring apparatus.

**Predictions:**
- Detectors alone don't collapse (consistent with some interpretations)
- Consciousness required for definite experience
- Wigner's friend experiments show observer-dependence

---

## 4.3 Null Hypotheses

### H0a: Objective Collapse

The wave function collapses through a physical mechanism, independent of consciousness.

**If true:**
- Should find physical collapse mechanism (not found)
- Consciousness irrelevant (contested)
- Deterministic or truly random

### H0b: Many-Worlds

No collapse occurs; all possibilities exist in parallel branches.

**If true:**
- Infinite copies of observer exist
- No special role for consciousness
- All outcomes "real"

## 4.4 Testable Predictions

### 4.4.1 Immediate Predictions

| Prediction | Test | Expected Result |
|------------|------|-----------------|
| Observer effect exists | Double-slit variations | ✓ Verified |
| Delayed choice works | Wheeler's experiment | ✓ Verified |
| Information matters | Quantum eraser | ✓ Verified |
| Observer-dependence | Wigner's friend | ✓ Recent support |

### 4.4.2 Extended Predictions

| Prediction | Test | Expected Result |
|------------|------|-----------------|
| Intention affects outcomes | Meditation + RNG | Preliminary support |
| Collective observation | Group experiments | Needs testing |
| Non-conscious devices | Detector-only | No true collapse |

---

## 4.5 Falsification Criteria

### H1 would be falsified if:

1. **Physical collapse mechanism found** — Clear non-conscious trigger identified
2. **Consciousness irrelevant** — Identical results with and without observer
3. **Probabilities truly random** — No Karmic/causal influence possible
4. **Many-Worlds confirmed** — Evidence of parallel branches

## 4.6 Hypothesis Summary

```
INTEGRATED HYPOTHESIS:
=====================

WAVE FUNCTION = MAYA (All possibilities)
OBSERVATION = RENDERING (One actualized)
PROBABILITY = KARMA (Causal weight)
OBSERVER = PURUSHA (Consciousness)

THE MEASUREMENT PROBLEM IS SOLVED:
• Maya exists as superposition
• Purusha renders one outcome
• Karma determines probability
• Experience arises from rendering
