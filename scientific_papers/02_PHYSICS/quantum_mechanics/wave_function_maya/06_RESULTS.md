## 6.1 Double-Slit Evidence

### 6.1.1 Experiment Summary

- Particles through two slits create interference pattern
- Observation of which-path destroys interference
- Pattern depends on information, not disturbance

### 6.1.2 Maya Interpretation

```
WITHOUT OBSERVATION:
===================
Particle in Maya (superposition of both paths)
-> Interference pattern

WITH OBSERVATION:
================
Rendering occurs (one path selected)
-> No interference

THIS PROVES:
Maya (superposition) exists until observation.
Observation = Rendering.
```

---

## 6.2 Delayed Choice Evidence

### 6.2.1 Wheeler's Experiment

- Decision to measure which-path made AFTER particle passes slits
- Still affects outcome
- Information determines reality, not time sequence

### 6.2.2 Maya Interpretation

```
DELAYED CHOICE SHOWS:
====================

Maya is time-independent.
Rendering is non-local in time.
What matters is OBSERVATION, not when.

This supports:
• Maya is potentiality, not physical
• Rendering creates the history
• Time is rendering dimension, not container
```

## 6.3 Quantum Eraser Evidence

### 6.3.1 Experiment Summary

- Mark which-path information
- Interference destroyed
- "Erase" which-path information
- Interference restored

### 6.3.2 Maya Interpretation

```
QUANTUM ERASER SHOWS:
====================

Not the physical disturbance that matters.
It's the INFORMATION (what is rendered).

Information = Maya state
Erasure = Maya restored to superposition
Interference = Maya expressing as wave

THIS IS PRECISELY THE MAYA MODEL.
```

## 6.4 Wigner's Friend Evidence

### 6.4.1 Recent Experiments (2019-2020)

Proietti et al. (2019): Facts are observer-dependent
- Different observers can have different "facts"
- No objective reality independent of observation
- Supports consciousness-based interpretation

### 6.4.2 Maya Interpretation

```
WIGNER'S FRIEND SHOWS:
=====================

Each observer has their own rendering.
There is no "objective" reality.
Reality is observer-dependent.

THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT MAYA MEANS:
• Different observers -> Different renderings
• No absolute reality independent of observation
• The world is rendered, not given
