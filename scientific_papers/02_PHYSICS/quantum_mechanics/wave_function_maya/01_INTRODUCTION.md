## 1.1 The Central Mystery of Quantum Mechanics

For a century, physicists have grappled with the wave function:

- **What IS it?** A probability wave? A real field? Information?
- **Why superposition?** How can something be in multiple states simultaneously?
- **Why does observation matter?** The measurement problem remains unsolved

These questions have spawned multiple interpretations, none fully satisfactory.

## 1.2 The Measurement Problem

### 1.2.1 The Standard Formulation

```
BEFORE MEASUREMENT:
|ψ⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩ (superposition)

AFTER MEASUREMENT:
|ψ⟩ -> |0⟩ or |1⟩ (definite state)

THE PROBLEM:
What triggers the change?
Why does observation matter?
Is the wave function "real"?
```

### 1.2.2 Why It Matters

The measurement problem implies:
- Reality is observer-dependent
- Consciousness plays a role in physics
- Something fundamental is missing from our understanding

## 1.3 Standard Interpretations

| Interpretation | Wave Function | Collapse | Problems |
|----------------|---------------|----------|----------|
| **Copenhagen** | Probability amplitude | On measurement | What defines "measurement"? |
| **Many-Worlds** | Real, branching | None (all occur) | Infinitely many worlds |
| **Objective Collapse** | Real, spontaneous | Physical process | No evidence |
| **Pilot Wave** | Real guiding field | None | Non-local, complex |
| **QBism** | Subjective belief | Observer-dependent | Solipsistic? |

None provides a complete, satisfying answer.

## 1.4 The Backend Framework

The Backend Framework offers a radical resolution:

### 1.4.1 Maya Defined

Maya (माया) = "That which can be measured" (from √मा, to measure)

Key properties:
- Neither real nor unreal
- Depends on observer
- Creates appearance from potentiality
- Dissolves upon true seeing

### 1.4.2 The Resolution

```
WAVE FUNCTION = MAYA:
====================

• Before observation: All possibilities exist (superposition)
• This is the nature of Maya — all potentialities
• Maya is NOT "illusion" — it's "measurement-dependent reality"

COLLAPSE = RENDERING:
====================

• Observer (Purusha) looks at system
• One possibility rendered into experience
• Selection based on Sankalpa + Karma + Gunas

NO MYSTERY:
• Unobserved = Potential = Wave function
• Observed = Rendered = Particle/outcome
```

## 1.5 Paper Structure

This paper will:
1. Review quantum mechanics experiments and interpretations
2. Present the Maya-wave function correspondence
3. Explain collapse as rendering
4. Validate against the 7-concept stack
5. Discuss implications for physics and philosophy

---

## 1.6 Significance

Understanding wave function as Maya would:
- Resolve the century-old measurement problem
- Unify consciousness and physics
- Validate ancient understanding through modern experiments
- Open new research directions
