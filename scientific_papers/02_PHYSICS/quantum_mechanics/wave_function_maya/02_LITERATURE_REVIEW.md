# 2. LITERATURE REVIEW

## 2.1 Development of Wave Mechanics

### 2.1.1 Schrödinger (1926)

Developed the wave equation:
```
iℏ ∂ψ/∂t = Ĥψ
```

Initially interpreted ψ as a real physical wave.

### 2.1.2 Born (1926)

Proposed probabilistic interpretation:
- |ψ|² = probability density
- Won Nobel Prize (1954)
- Established Copenhagen framework

### 2.1.3 Heisenberg (1927)

Uncertainty principle:
- ΔxΔp ≥ ℏ/2
- Limits on simultaneous knowledge
- Supports Maya interpretation (measurement creates reality)

---

## 2.2 The Copenhagen Interpretation

### 2.2.1 Key Features

- Wave function = probability amplitude
- Collapse = instantaneous, discontinuous
- Measurement defines reality
- No deeper explanation offered

### 2.2.2 Problems

- What counts as "measurement"?
- Is consciousness required?
- Why does observation matter?
- "Shut up and calculate" isn't explanation

---

## 2.3 Alternative Interpretations

### 2.3.1 Many-Worlds (Everett, 1957)

- No collapse — all branches exist
- Universe splits at each measurement
- Requires infinite parallel realities

### 2.3.2 Pilot Wave (de Broglie-Bohm)

- Particles have definite positions
- Guided by wave function
- Non-local, deterministic

### 2.3.3 Objective Collapse (GRW, Penrose)

- Spontaneous collapse without observer
- Physical mechanism proposed
- No experimental evidence

### 2.3.4 QBism (Fuchs, Mermin)

- Wave function = subjective belief
- Collapse = belief update
- Observer-dependent but avoids consciousness

---

## 2.4 Consciousness-Based Interpretations

### 2.4.1 Von Neumann-Wigner

- Consciousness causes collapse
- Observer's mind terminates infinite regress
- Controversial but coherent

### 2.4.2 Stapp (2007)

- Quantum mind-brain interaction
- Free will operates through collapse
- Consciousness selects from possibilities

### 2.4.3 Penrose-Hameroff

- Consciousness from quantum coherence
- Objective reduction in microtubules
- Connects consciousness to physics

---

## 2.5 Key Experiments

### 2.5.1 Double-Slit

- Wave behavior without observation
- Particle behavior with observation
- Observer effect demonstrated

### 2.5.2 Delayed Choice (Wheeler)

- Decision after particle passes slit
- Still affects interference pattern
- Time-independence of observation effect

### 2.5.3 Quantum Eraser

- Erasing "which-path" info restores interference
- Information determines behavior
- Not just physical disturbance

### 2.5.4 Wigner's Friend

- Friend measures, Wigner observes friend
- When does collapse occur?
- Recent experiments show observer-dependence

## 2.6 Backend Framework Sources

### 2.6.1 Maya in Texts

> **"माया हि ईश्वरस्य शक्तिः"**
> "Maya is indeed the power of the Lord."
> — Shvetashvatara Upanishad 4.10

> **"मायां तु प्रकृतिं विद्यान्मायिनं तु महेश्वरम्"**
> "Know Maya as Prakriti, and the Lord as the wielder of Maya."
> — Shvetashvatara Upanishad 4.10

### 2.6.2 Superposition in Texts

> **"सदसद्भ्यामनिर्वचनीया"**
> "Neither real nor unreal — indescribable."
> — Shankaracharya on Maya

This precisely describes quantum superposition.

## 2.7 Research Gaps

| Gap | Current Status | This Paper's Contribution |
|-----|----------------|--------------------------|
| Measurement problem | Unsolved | Maya = superposition |
| Observer role | Mysterious | Purusha = renderer |
| Collapse mechanism | Unknown | Rendering = selection |
| Why probabilities | Unexplained | Karma determines |
