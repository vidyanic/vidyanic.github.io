## 🎯 KEY QUESTION

**What IS the wave function? Why does observation collapse it? What determines which possibility becomes reality?**

---

## 📋 QUICK ANSWERS

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| What is wave function? | Maya — Superposition of all possibilities |
| Why collapse on observation? | Observer (Purusha) selects from Maya |
| What determines outcome? | Sankalpa (intention) + Karma + Guna state |
| Is reality objective? | No — Reality is observer-dependent (rendered) |
| Multiple observers? | Collective rendering (Brahma's dream) |

|   MAYA (माया) = SUPERPOSITION OF ALL POSSIBILITIES                       |
|   =================================================                       |
|   • Before observation: All possibilities exist simultaneously           |
|   • This IS the wave function                                            |
|   • Maya = "That which can be measured" (मा = to measure)                |
|                                                                           |
|   COLLAPSE = OBSERVER RENDERING                                          |
|   ==============================                                          |
|   • Observer (Purusha) looks at system                                   |
|   • One possibility "selected" from superposition                        |
|   • Selection based on: Sankalpa + Karma + Gunas                         |

## 📊 THE SCHRÖDINGER EQUATION

```
iℏ ∂|ψ⟩/∂t = Ĥ|ψ⟩

BACKEND INTERPRETATION:
=======================

|ψ⟩ = MAYA STATE (all possibilities)
Ĥ = DHARMA OPERATOR (rules of the simulation)
t = KALA (time rendering)
ℏ = Minimum action quantum (pixel-tick ratio)

The equation describes how Maya (wave function)
evolves according to Dharma (Hamiltonian).

BEFORE OBSERVATION:
|ψ⟩ = Σ cᵢ|φᵢ⟩ (superposition of all states)

AFTER OBSERVATION:
|ψ⟩ -> |φₖ⟩ (one state selected)

The "collapse" is the RENDERING of one possibility.
```

## 🎯 WHY OBSERVATION MATTERS

### The Measurement Problem

```
STANDARD PHYSICS QUESTION:
=========================
"Why does consciousness collapse the wave function?"

BACKEND ANSWER:
===============
Consciousness (Purusha) IS the rendering engine.
Without observer, nothing is rendered.
Wave function describes what CAN be rendered.
Observation IS the rendering.

There's no mystery:
• Unobserved = Not rendered = Superposition
• Observed = Rendered = One outcome
```
