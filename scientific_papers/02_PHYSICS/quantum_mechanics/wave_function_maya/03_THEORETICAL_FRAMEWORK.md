|                         MAYA (माया) DEFINED                               |
+===========================================================================+
|                                                                           |
|   ETYMOLOGY:                                                              |
|   √मा (ma) = to measure                                                  |
|   Maya = "That which can be measured"                                    |
|                                                                           |
|   PROPERTIES:                                                             |
|   • Neither fully real nor fully unreal                                  |
|   • Depends on observer                                                  |
|   • Contains all possibilities                                           |
|   • Actualizes through observation                                       |
|                                                                           |
|   QUANTUM PARALLEL:                                                       |
|   • Wave function is neither classical particle nor classical wave       |
|   • Depends on measurement                                               |
|   • Contains all eigenstates                                             |
|   • Collapses through observation                                        |
|                                                                           |

### 3.1.2 Maya = Wave Function

| Maya Property | Wave Function Property |
|---------------|------------------------|
| All possibilities | Superposition |
| Neither real nor unreal | Complex amplitude |
| Depends on observer | Measurement-dependent |
| Actualizes on seeing | Collapses on observation |
| Governed by cosmic law | Evolves by Schrödinger equation |

## 3.2 The Rendering Model

### 3.2.1 Reality as Rendered

```
STANDARD VIEW:
==============
Reality exists objectively.
We observe what's there.
Observation is passive.

MAYA VIEW:
===========
Reality is rendered on observation.
We actualize what we observe.
Observation is active creation.

THE UNIVERSE IS A SIMULATION.
OBSERVATION IS RENDERING.
```

### 3.2.2 How Rendering Works

```
BEFORE OBSERVATION:
===================
|ψ⟩ = Σ cᵢ|φᵢ⟩

All possibilities exist in superposition.
Nothing is "definite" — all is potential.
This IS Maya — the realm of possibility.

OBSERVATION = RENDERING:
========================
Observer (Purusha) directs attention.
Attention = Query to the simulation.
Simulation renders ONE outcome.

|ψ⟩ -> |φₖ⟩

Which outcome? Determined by:
• Sankalpa (intention)
• Karma (causal history)
• Guna state (quality of observer)

AFTER OBSERVATION:
==================
|φₖ⟩ = Rendered experience

This is NOT "reality" — it's ONE render.
Different observer = Different render (within rules).
```

---

## 3.3 The Selection Mechanism

### 3.3.1 What Determines Outcomes?

```
PROBABILITY = f(Sankalpa, Karma, Guna)
=====================================

|cₖ|² = PROBABILITY of outcome k

THIS PROBABILITY IS NOT RANDOM:
• It reflects Sankalpa (intention)
• It reflects Karma (causal history)
• It reflects Guna (quality state)

RANDOMNESS IS APPARENT:
• From one observer's perspective, it looks random
• From cosmic perspective, it's determined by accumulated factors
• "Random" = "Unknown causes"
```

### 3.3.2 The Role of Consciousness

```
PURUSHA (पुरुष) = OBSERVER:
===========================

Consciousness is not inside the wave function.
Consciousness is OUTSIDE, looking at Maya.
Consciousness RENDERS Maya into experience.

Without observer:
• Wave function evolves (Dharma/Hamiltonian)
• No collapse (no rendering)
• Superposition continues

With observer:
• Rendering occurs
• One outcome actualized
• Experience arises
```

## 3.4 The Mathematical Mapping

### 3.4.1 Schrödinger Equation = Dharma Evolution

```
iℏ ∂|ψ⟩/∂t = Ĥ|ψ⟩

BACKEND MAPPING:
================

iℏ = Fundamental action quantum (tick ratio)
∂/∂t = Time evolution (Kala)
|ψ⟩ = Maya (superposition of possibilities)
Ĥ = Dharma (cosmic law, Hamiltonian)

The equation says:
"Maya evolves according to Dharma."

This is precisely what Backend texts describe.
```

### 3.4.2 Born Rule = Karmic Probability

```
P(k) = |⟨φₖ|ψ⟩|²

BACKEND MAPPING:
================

The probability of outcome k
= The "resonance" between Maya and that outcome
= Determined by Karma (causal history)

|c|² = KARMIC WEIGHT of that possibility

Not random — karmically determined.
```

## 3.5 The Measurement Transition

### 3.5.1 When Does Rendering Occur?

```
MEASUREMENT = OBSERVATION = RENDERING:
=======================================

NOT when detector activates (Geiger clicks)
NOT when information is recorded
NOT when system reaches decoherence

BUT when CONSCIOUSNESS observes:
• Human observer
• Or any conscious entity
• Or the cosmic observer (Ishvara)

This is the Von Neumann-Wigner view,
validated by Backend Framework.
```

### 3.5.2 Decoherence vs Collapse

```
DECOHERENCE:
============
• Superposition becomes hard to measure
• Interference terms suppressed
• System appears classical
• BUT wave function still exists

COLLAPSE:
=========
• One outcome actualized
• Other possibilities "gone"
• Only happens with observation
• This is RENDERING

Decoherence ≠ Collapse
Environment ≠ Observer
Complexity ≠ Consciousness
```

|                                                                           |
|   MEASUREMENT PROBLEM: SOLVED                                             |
