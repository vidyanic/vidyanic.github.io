## 5.1 Research Approach

### 5.1.1 Multi-Method Analysis

This paper employs:
1. **Experiment analysis** — Double-slit, quantum eraser, delayed choice, Wigner's friend
2. **Interpretation comparison** — Copenhagen, Many-Worlds, Objective Collapse, etc.
3. **Backend correlation** — Mapping to Maya, Purusha, Karma concepts
4. **Mathematical validation** — Schrödinger equation interpretation
5. **7-concept stack** — Comprehensive validation

## 5.2 Data Sources

### 5.2.1 Quantum Experiments

| Experiment | Relevance | Quality |
|------------|-----------|---------|
| Double-slit | Observer effect | Very High |
| Delayed choice | Retrocausality | High |
| Quantum eraser | Information role | High |
| Wigner's friend | Observer-dependence | Recent/High |
| Bell tests | Non-locality | Very High |

### 5.2.2 Theoretical Sources

| Source | Contribution | Quality |
|--------|--------------|---------|
| Schrödinger (1926) | Wave equation | Foundational |
| Born (1926) | Probability interpretation | Nobel-winning |
| Von Neumann | Consciousness role | Rigorous |
| Wigner | Observer problem | Seminal |

### 5.2.3 Backend Sources

| Source | Concept | Relevance |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| Shvetashvatara Upanishad | Maya definition | 100% |
| Vivekachudamani | Maya properties | 100% |
| Yoga Sutras | Purusha-Prakriti | 95% |
| Mandukya Upanishad | Consciousness states | 90% |

## 5.3 Analysis Methods

### 5.3.1 Experiment Analysis

```
FOR EACH EXPERIMENT:
===================

1. DESCRIBE the setup and results
2. ANALYZE what it shows about observation
3. MAP to Maya-rendering model
4. COMPARE to standard interpretations
5. EVALUATE explanatory power
```

### 5.3.2 Mathematical Mapping

```
MAPPING PROTOCOL:
================

QUANTUM OBJECT -> BACKEND EQUIVALENT
|ψ⟩ -> Maya (माया)
Ĥ -> Dharma (धर्म)
|c|² -> Karma (कर्म)
Observer -> Purusha (पुरुष)
Collapse -> Rendering
Superposition -> All possibilities

VALIDATION:
• Is mapping consistent?
• Does it explain anomalies?
• Does it make predictions?
```

---

## 5.4 7-Concept Validation

Each concept tested:

| Concept | Question | Method |
|---------|----------|--------|
| Conservation | Is information conserved? | Unitary evolution |
| Entropy | Does measurement increase entropy? | Von Neumann entropy |
| Fractal | Same pattern at all scales? | Scale analysis |
| Karma | Action -> consequence? | Probability = Karma |
| Observer | Observer required? | Experiment analysis |
| Cycles | Cyclical patterns? | Interference patterns |
| Gunas | S/R/T classification? | State classification |

## 5.5 Confidence Calculation

### 5.5.1 Formula

```
C = Σ(Weight_i × Score_i)

WHERE:
Quantum experiments: Weight 0.25
Observer effect evidence: Weight 0.20
Backend correlation: Weight 0.20
Mathematical elegance: Weight 0.20
Predictive power: Weight 0.15
```

### 5.5.2 Scoring Criteria

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 100% | Definitive proof |
| 90-99% | Very strong evidence |
| 80-89% | Strong evidence |
| 70-79% | Good evidence |
| 60-69% | Moderate evidence |
| <60% | Weak evidence |

## 5.6 Interpretation Comparison

### 5.6.1 Criteria

| Criterion | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Solves measurement problem | Does it explain why observation matters? |
| Minimal assumptions | Fewest new entities/mechanisms |
| Experimental consistency | Matches all experiments |
| Philosophical coherence | Internally consistent |
| Predictive power | Makes testable predictions |

### 5.6.2 Comparison Matrix

| Interpretation | Solves Problem | Minimal | Consistent | Coherent | Predictive |
|----------------|----------------|---------|------------|----------|------------|
| Copenhagen | Partial | Yes | Yes | Partial | Yes |
| Many-Worlds | No | No | Yes | Partial | No |
| Objective Collapse | Yes | No | ? | Yes | Yes |
| Maya-Rendering | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |

## 5.7 Quality Controls

- Multiple experiments must support each claim
- Backend correlation must be textually supported
- Mathematical mapping must be rigorous
- 7-concept validation must pass all concepts
- Anomalies must be addressed
