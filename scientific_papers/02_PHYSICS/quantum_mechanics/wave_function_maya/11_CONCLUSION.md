## 11.1 Summary of Findings

This paper has validated the Maya interpretation of the quantum wave function:

### 11.1.1 Core Findings

1. **Wave function = Maya** — Superposition of all possibilities
2. **Collapse = Rendering** — Consciousness actualizes one outcome
3. **Observer = Purusha** — Consciousness is essential
4. **Probability = Karma** — Outcomes are Karmically weighted
5. **Measurement problem solved** — No mystery when consciousness is primary

## 11.8 Final Statement

> **"यथा सर्पः रज्जौ तथा जगत्"**
> "As a snake appears in a rope, so does the world appear."
> — Vivekachudamani

For a century, physicists struggled with the wave function. What is it? Why does it collapse? Why does observation matter?

The answer was always there, in texts thousands of years old:

**The wave function is Maya.**
**Collapse is rendering.**
**The observer is Purusha.**
**Probability is Karma.**

Quantum mechanics isn't mysterious — it's the mathematics of how consciousness creates reality.

The measurement problem was never a problem.
It was just that physics forgot consciousness.
