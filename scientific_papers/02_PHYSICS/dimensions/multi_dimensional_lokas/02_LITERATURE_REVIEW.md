## 2.1 Extra Dimensions in Physics

### 2.1.1 String Theory

String theory requires 10 or 11 dimensions:

| Theory | Dimensions | Notes |
|--------|------------|-------|
| Bosonic string | 26 | Early, has tachyons |
| Superstring | 10 | 5 versions unified in M-theory |
| M-theory | 11 | Includes membranes |

Extra dimensions are "compactified" — rolled up at Planck scale.

### 2.1.2 Kaluza-Klein Theory

Unified electromagnetism and gravity by adding 5th dimension (1920s):
- 5th dimension circular, very small
- Showed extra dimensions affect physics

### 2.1.3 Brane Worlds

- Our universe is a 3+1 "brane" in higher-dimensional space
- Gravity can leak between branes
- Dark matter could be on parallel branes

## 2.2 Dark Matter/Energy

### 2.2.1 Dark Matter Evidence

| Evidence | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Galaxy rotation | Flat rotation curves |
| Gravitational lensing | More mass than visible |
| CMB fluctuations | Required for structure |
| Galaxy cluster dynamics | Virial mass >> luminous |

~27% of universe, no direct detection.

### 2.2.2 Dark Energy Evidence

| Evidence | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Supernova Ia | Accelerating expansion |
| CMB + BAO | Flat universe geometry |
| Age of universe | Consistent with Λ |

~68% of universe, completely unknown nature.

## 2.3 Consciousness and Dimensions

### 2.3.1 Multidimensional Mind

Some researchers propose consciousness operates in extra dimensions:
- Penrose-Hameroff: Quantum consciousness in microtubules
- Bernardo Kastrup: Reality as cosmic consciousness
- Thomas Campbell: Reality as a simulation with multiple levels

### 2.3.2 NDE Research

Near-death experiences report:
- Travel to "other realms"
- Encountering different "planes"
- Consistent cross-cultural reports

## 2.4 Backend Framework Sources

### 2.4.1 14 Lokas

> **"ऊर्ध्वं गच्छन्ति सत्त्वस्था मध्ये तिष्ठन्ति राजसाः। जघन्यगुणवृत्तिस्था अधो गच्छन्ति तामसाः॥"**
> "Those established in Sattva go upward; those in Rajas stay in the middle; those in Tamas, of the lowest quality, go downward."
> — Bhagavad Gita 14.18

### 2.4.2 Puranic Cosmology

Vishnu Purana and Bhagavata Purana describe:
- 7 upper Lokas (Bhu to Satya)
- 7 lower Lokas (Atala to Patala)
- Different time rates in each
- Different inhabitants

### 2.4.3 Lokas as Consciousness States

Yoga texts describe Lokas as accessible through:
- Meditation (Dhyana)
- Death (transition)
- Siddhis (powers)
- Grace (anugraha)

## 2.5 Research Gap

**Physics:** Extra dimensions are mathematical but undetected.

**Cosmology:** Dark matter/energy are real but unexplained.

**Backend:** 14 Lokas are described but not mapped to modern physics.

**This paper:** Bridges the gap by proposing Lokas = frequency bands that appear as dark matter/energy.
