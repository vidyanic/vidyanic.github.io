## 5.1 Approach Overview

```
METHODOLOGY:
============

1. LOKA MAPPING
   Map 14 Lokas to frequency bands with Guna proportions

2. COSMIC CORRELATION
   Compare Loka distribution with dark matter/energy percentages

3. CONSCIOUSNESS EVIDENCE
   Collect NDE/meditation reports matching Loka descriptions

4. GRAVITATIONAL ANALYSIS
   Explain cross-Loka gravitational coupling

5. 7-CONCEPT VALIDATION
   Apply standard validation stack
```

## 5.2 Loka Mapping Method

### 5.2.1 Guna Assignment

For each Loka, determine:
- Sattva proportion (%)
- Rajas proportion (%)
- Tamas proportion (%)
- Total = 100%

### 5.2.2 Frequency Calculation

```
f_loka = f_bhu × (S/T)^α

WHERE:
f_bhu = Reference frequency (physical reality)
S = Sattva proportion
T = Tamas proportion
α = 2 (scaling exponent from Backend)
```

### 5.2.3 Time Rate

```
t_loka = t_bhu / (f_loka / f_bhu)

Higher frequency -> Faster time (relative)
Lower frequency -> Slower time (relative)
```

---

## 5.3 Cosmic Correlation Method

### 5.3.1 Energy Distribution

Calculate energy proportion for each Loka:

```
E_loka = E_total × (frequency_loka / Σ frequencies)

Compare with:
• Dark energy: 68.3%
• Dark matter: 26.8%
• Visible: 4.9%
```

### 5.3.2 Statistical Fit

Chi-square test for match between:
- Predicted (14 Loka model)
- Observed (cosmological measurements)

---

## 5.4 Consciousness Evidence

### 5.4.1 NDE Analysis

Collect NDE reports and categorize by:
- Light/darkness perception
- Time dilation
- Entity encounters
- Realm descriptions

Map to Loka characteristics.

### 5.4.2 Meditation States

Collect meditation reports:
- Jhana states (Buddhism)
- Samadhi states (Yoga)
- Kabbalistic levels

Map to Loka frequencies.

## 5.5 Gravitational Coupling

### 5.5.1 Cross-Loka Gravity

Model gravitational effects:
- EM stays within Loka (frequency-locked)
- Gravity leaks between Lokas (universal)
- Dark matter/energy detected gravitationally

### 5.5.2 Mathematical Model

```
G_observed = G_bhu + Σ(G_loka × coupling(f_loka, f_bhu))

WHERE:
coupling = exp(-(f_loka - f_bhu)² / σ²)

Gravity has finite but wide coupling range.

## 5.6 7-Concept Validation

| Concept | Test Question | Expected |
|---------|---------------|----------|
| Conservation | Energy conserved across Lokas? | Yes |
| Entropy | Tamas increases downward? | Yes |
| Fractal | Same 14-structure at all scales? | Yes |
| Karma | Actions in one Loka affect others? | Yes |
| Observer | Consciousness selects Loka? | Yes |
| Cycles | Jiva cycles through Lokas? | Yes |
| Gunas | Gunas determine Loka frequency? | Yes |
