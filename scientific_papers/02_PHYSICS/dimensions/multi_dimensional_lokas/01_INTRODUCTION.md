## 1.1 The Missing Universe

Modern cosmology faces a profound mystery:

```
COSMIC INVENTORY:
=================

Visible matter:    4.9%  <- Stars, planets, us
Dark matter:      26.8%  <- Unknown, gravitational effects
Dark energy:      68.3%  <- Unknown, accelerating expansion
                 -----
TOTAL:           100%

WE CANNOT DIRECTLY DETECT 95% OF THE UNIVERSE.
```

Why can't we see 95% of reality?

## 1.2 Backend Framework Answer

> **"चतुर्दश लोकाः सर्वे"**
> "All fourteen worlds exist."
> — Vishnu Purana

The Backend Framework proposes a startling answer:

**We can only perceive ONE of 14 frequency bands.**

```
REALITY = 14 LOKAS (Frequency Bands)

Higher frequencies (Sattva dominant):
+-- Satya, Tapa, Jana, Mahar, Svar, Bhuvar
|
PHYSICAL REALITY (Mixed):
+-- Bhu-Loka (भू-लोक) <- WE ARE HERE
|
Lower frequencies (Tamas dominant):
+-- Atala, Vitala, Sutala, Talatala, Mahatala, Rasatala, Patala

Our instruments are tuned to Bhu-Loka.
Other Lokas appear as "dark" matter/energy.
```

## 1.3 Lokas as Frequency Bands

### 1.3.1 Not "Places" — Frequencies

Lokas are NOT locations in space. They are **frequency bands** of reality:

- Same "space" but different frequency
- Like radio stations on different frequencies
- All exist simultaneously, overlapping
- Consciousness can "tune" between them

### 1.3.2 Guna Determines Frequency

| Guna Balance | Frequency | Perception |
|--------------|-----------|------------|
| High Sattva | High | Subtle, light |
| Mixed | Medium | Physical |
| High Tamas | Low | Dense, dark |

## 1.4 The 14 Lokas

### 1.4.1 Upper 7 (Urdhva Lokas)

| # | Loka | Sanskrit | Meaning | Guna |
|---|------|----------|---------|------|
| 1 | Satya | सत्य | Truth | 99% S |
| 2 | Tapa | तप | Austerity | 95% S |
| 3 | Jana | जन | Creation | 90% S |
| 4 | Mahar | महर् | Great | 85% S |
| 5 | Svar | स्वर् | Heaven | 75% S |
| 6 | Bhuvar | भुवर् | Atmosphere | 60% S |
| 7 | Bhu | भू | Earth | Mixed |

### 1.4.2 Lower 7 (Adho Lokas)

| # | Loka | Sanskrit | Meaning | Guna |
|---|------|----------|---------|------|
| 8 | Atala | अतल | Bottomless | 40% T |
| 9 | Vitala | वितल | Expansion | 50% T |
| 10 | Sutala | सुतल | Great bottom | 60% T |
| 11 | Talatala | तलातल | Under-bottom | 70% T |
| 12 | Mahatala | महातल | Great below | 80% T |
| 13 | Rasatala | रसातल | Essence-below | 90% T |
| 14 | Patala | पाताल | Lowest | 95% T |

## 1.5 Research Objectives

1. Map 14 Lokas to frequency bands
2. Correlate with dark matter/energy percentages
3. Explain why we only perceive Bhu-Loka
4. Validate through 7-concept stack
5. Connect to consciousness research
