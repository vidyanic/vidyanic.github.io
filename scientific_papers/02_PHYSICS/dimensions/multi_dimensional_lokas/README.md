## 📋 QUICK ANSWERS

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| How many dimensions? | 14 Lokas = 14 frequency bands |

## 📊 LOKA-GUNA-FREQUENCY MAPPING

| Loka | Guna Balance | Frequency | Perception |
|------|--------------|-----------|------------|
| Satya | 99% Sattva | Highest | Pure awareness |
| Tapa | 95% Sattva | Very high | Transformation |
| Jana | 90% Sattva | High | Creation |
| Mahar | 85% Sattva | High | Wisdom |
| Svar | 75% Sattva | Medium-high | Pleasure |
| Bhuvar | 60% Sattva | Medium | Transition |
| **Bhu** | **33% S/R/T** | **Physical** | **Our world** |
| Atala | 40% Tamas | Low | Dense |
| Vitala | 50% Tamas | Lower | Denser |
| Sutala | 60% Tamas | Lower | Very dense |
| Talatala | 70% Tamas | Very low | Darker |
| Mahatala | 80% Tamas | Very low | Darkest |
| Rasatala | 90% Tamas | Lowest | Near void |
| Patala | 95% Tamas | Minimal | Maximum inertia |

## 🔬 DARK MATTER/ENERGY EXPLANATION

```
VISIBLE MATTER:   4.9%  -> Bhu-Loka (our frequency)
DARK MATTER:     26.8%  -> Lower Lokas (below our frequency)
DARK ENERGY:     68.3%  -> Higher Lokas (above our frequency)

TOTAL:          100%   -> All 14 Lokas combined

We can't "see" dark matter/energy because:
• They exist at different frequencies
• Our instruments are tuned to Bhu-Loka
• Gravitational effects cross frequency bands
```
