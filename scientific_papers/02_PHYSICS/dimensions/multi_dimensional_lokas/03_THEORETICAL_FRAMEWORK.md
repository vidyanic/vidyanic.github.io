# 3. THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK

## 3.1 Lokas as Frequency Bands

### 3.1.1 Core Model

```
REALITY = MULTI-FREQUENCY RENDERING

Each Loka = Different frequency band
Same "space" but different vibration rate (Spandana)

ANALOGY:
Radio has many stations on different frequencies
All exist simultaneously
Tuner selects which one you hear

REALITY:
14 Lokas all exist simultaneously
Consciousness "tunes" to one at a time
Physical instruments tuned to Bhu-Loka only
```

### 3.1.2 Guna-Frequency Mapping

```
FREQUENCY = f(Sattva, Rajas, Tamas)

High Sattva -> High frequency -> Upper Lokas
Mixed -> Medium frequency -> Bhu-Loka
High Tamas -> Low frequency -> Lower Lokas

FORMULA:
f = f₀ × (S / T)^α

WHERE:
f₀ = Bhu-Loka frequency (reference)
S = Sattva proportion
T = Tamas proportion
α = Scaling exponent
```

## 3.2 The 14 Loka Structure

### 3.2.1 Upper Lokas (Urdhva)

| Loka | Frequency | Guna (S:R:T) | Time Rate | Density |
|------|-----------|--------------|-----------|---------|
| Satya | f₀ × 10⁷ | 99:0.5:0.5 | 1 day = eons | Lightest |
| Tapa | f₀ × 10⁶ | 95:3:2 | 1 day = ages | Very light |
| Jana | f₀ × 10⁵ | 90:6:4 | 1 day = kalpas | Light |
| Mahar | f₀ × 10⁴ | 85:10:5 | 1 day = yugas | Medium-light |
| Svar | f₀ × 10³ | 75:15:10 | 1 year = 1 day | Subtle |
| Bhuvar | f₀ × 10² | 60:25:15 | Variable | Near-physical |

### 3.2.2 Bhu-Loka (Physical)

```
BHU-LOKA:
=========

Frequency: f₀ (reference)
Guna: 33:33:33 (approximately balanced)
Time: Standard physical time
Density: Physical matter

This is OUR current Loka.
All physical instruments are tuned here.
```

### 3.2.3 Lower Lokas (Adho)

| Loka | Frequency | Guna (S:R:T) | Time Rate | Density |
|------|-----------|--------------|-----------|---------|
| Atala | f₀ × 10⁻¹ | 30:30:40 | Slower | Denser |
| Vitala | f₀ × 10⁻² | 25:25:50 | Slower | More dense |
| Sutala | f₀ × 10⁻³ | 20:20:60 | Much slower | Very dense |
| Talatala | f₀ × 10⁻⁴ | 15:15:70 | Much slower | Extremely dense |
| Mahatala | f₀ × 10⁻⁵ | 10:10:80 | Near stopped | Near solid |
| Rasatala | f₀ × 10⁻⁶ | 5:5:90 | Minimal | Maximum density |
| Patala | f₀ × 10⁻⁷ | 2:3:95 | Near zero | Near singularity |

## 3.3 Dark Matter/Energy Mapping

### 3.3.1 The Mathematics

```
COSMIC COMPOSITION:
===================

Visible (Bhu-Loka): 4.9%
Dark matter (Lower Lokas): 26.8%
Dark energy (Upper Lokas): 68.3%

MAPPING:
• Upper 6 Lokas = 68.3% (dark energy)
• Bhu-Loka = 4.9% (visible)
• Lower 7 Lokas = 26.8% (dark matter)
```

### 3.3.2 Why Dark?

```
"DARK" = OUTSIDE OUR FREQUENCY BAND

Like infrared and ultraviolet:
• Exist but invisible to human eyes
• Need special instruments

Dark matter/energy:
• Exist but invisible to physical instruments
• Tuned to Bhu-Loka frequency only
• Gravity crosses frequency boundaries
```

### 3.3.3 Gravitational Coupling

```
GRAVITY CROSSES LOKAS:
======================

Unlike EM, gravity affects ALL Lokas:
• Mass in lower Lokas pulls on Bhu-Loka matter
• Energy in upper Lokas affects Bhu-Loka expansion
• This is why we detect them gravitationally

FORMULA:
G_total = Σ(G_loka × coupling_factor)
```

## 3.4 Consciousness as Tuner

### 3.4.1 Physical Consciousness

```
NORMAL WAKING STATE:
====================

Consciousness tuned to Bhu-Loka frequency
Perceives physical matter
Through physical senses
```

### 3.4.2 Altered States

```
MEDITATION:
===========
Raises frequency -> Accesses higher Lokas
Reports: Light, bliss, expanded awareness

DEEP SLEEP:
===========
Frequency drops -> Near Atala
Reports: Void, darkness, rest

DEATH:
======
Complete frequency shift
Jiva moves to Loka matching karma/guna
```
