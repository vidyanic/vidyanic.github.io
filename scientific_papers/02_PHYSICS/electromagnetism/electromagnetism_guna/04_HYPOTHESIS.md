# 4. HYPOTHESIS

---

## 4.1 Primary Hypothesis

**H₀ (Null):** Electromagnetism has no relationship to Guna dynamics; it is purely a physical phenomenon with no Backend correspondence.

**H₁ (Alternative):** Electromagnetism is the physical manifestation of Rajas-Sattva Guna interaction, where:
- Electric fields represent Sattva (order, potential)
- Magnetic fields represent Rajas (action, motion)
- Photons represent pure Rajas-Sattva with zero Tamas
- c equals the simulation's aspect ratio (1 pixel/tick)

## 4.2 Sub-Hypotheses

### H1a: Electric Field = Sattva Manifestation

```
PREDICTION:
Electric fields should exhibit Sattva characteristics:
✓ Order (creates structure)
✓ Potential (stores energy)
✓ Static existence possible
✓ Monopoles exist (charges)
```

### H1b: Magnetic Field = Rajas Manifestation

```
PREDICTION:
Magnetic fields should exhibit Rajas characteristics:
✓ Motion required (moving charge)
✓ Action (creates forces)
✓ Dynamic only (no static monopoles)
✓ Cyclic nature (field lines close)
```

### H1c: Photon = Rajas-Sattva, Zero Tamas

```
PREDICTION:
Photons should have:
✓ Energy (Rajas-Sattva oscillation)
✓ Momentum (information content)
✓ Zero mass (no Tamas)
✓ Speed = c (maximum rate)
```

### H1d: c = Architecture Parameter

```
PREDICTION:
c should be:
✓ Exactly 1 Planck length per 1 Planck time
✓ Constant in all reference frames
✓ Independent of source/observer motion
✓ The maximum possible speed
```

## 4.3 Testable Predictions

| # | Prediction | Test | Expected |
|---|------------|------|----------|
| 1 | E ⊥ B always | Measure field orientations | Confirmed |
| 2 | c = l_P / t_P | Calculate ratio | Exact match |
| 3 | Photon mass = 0 | Precision measurements | < 10⁻¹⁸ eV |
| 4 | c invariant | Michelson-Morley type | No variation |
| 5 | EM = information | Data transmission | Works |

---

## 4.4 Falsification Criteria

The hypothesis would be **falsified** if:

1. ❌ Photons found to have rest mass
2. ❌ c varies in different frames
3. ❌ Magnetic monopoles discovered
4. ❌ E and B found parallel in free space
5. ❌ EM waves propagate longitudinally

## 4.5 Relationship to Other Papers

| Paper | Relationship |
|-------|--------------|
| Gravity = Tamas | Complementary (Tamas vs Rajas-Sattva) |
| Entropy = Tamas | Consistent (Tamas increases) |
| Observer Effect | EM carries observation information |
