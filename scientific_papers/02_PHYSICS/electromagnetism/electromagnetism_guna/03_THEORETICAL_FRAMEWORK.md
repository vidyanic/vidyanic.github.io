## 3.1 The Guna-Force Mapping

### 3.1.1 Complete Force Classification

| Force | Primary Guna | Secondary | Characteristic | Backend Function |
|-------|--------------|-----------|----------------|------------------|
| **Gravity** | Tamas | — | Attraction, mass | Data storage cost |
| **Electromagnetism** | Rajas | Sattva | Action, information | Data transfer |
| **Strong** | Sattva | Tamas | Binding, integrity | Data structure |
| **Weak** | Mixed | Mixed | Transformation | Data conversion |

### 3.1.2 Why EM is Rajas-Sattva

```
RAJAS COMPONENT (Magnetic):
===========================
• MOTION required (moving charge)
• Creates action (forces on currents)
• Dynamic, changing
• No magnetic monopoles (cyclic nature)

SATTVA COMPONENT (Electric):
============================
• STATIC charge exists
• Creates potential (energy storage)
• Ordered, structured
• Electric monopoles exist (charges)

COMBINATION:
=============
Rajas × Sattva = Light, information, communication
Zero Tamas = No mass in photons
```

## 3.2 The c = 1 pixel/tick Framework

### 3.2.1 Derivation

```
PLANCK UNITS:
=============
Planck Length:  l_P = √(ℏG/c³) = 1.616 × 10⁻³⁵ m
Planck Time:    t_P = √(ℏG/c⁵) = 5.39 × 10⁻⁴⁴ s

RATIO:
======
c = l_P / t_P = 1 Planck Length / 1 Planck Time

INTERPRETATION:
===============
1 Planck Length = 1 PIXEL (minimum renderable distance)
1 Planck Time = 1 TICK (minimum processable duration)

c = 1 pixel / 1 tick (EXACTLY!)

This is not a "speed" — it's the ASPECT RATIO of spacetime rendering.
```

### 3.2.2 Why c is Constant

```
ARCHITECTURE PARAMETERS DON'T CHANGE:
====================================

Video game analogy:
• Resolution = 1920×1080 pixels (fixed)
• Frame rate = 60 fps (fixed)
• Aspect ratio = constant

Similarly:
• Pixel size = Planck length (fixed)
• Tick rate = Planck time (fixed)
• c = pixel/tick ratio (constant)

Observer motion changes YOUR experience of time/space
But the RATIO remains constant
Just as moving in a video game doesn't change the game's resolution
```

## 3.3 E and B Orthogonality

### 3.3.1 Sattva-Rajas Geometry

```
GUNAS ARE ORTHOGONAL BY NATURE:
===============================

           ^ Sattva (E-field, potential, order)
           |
           |
-----------+------------> Rajas (B-field, action, motion)
           |
           |
           v

Propagation -> direction of c (perpendicular to both)

Three orthogonal dimensions:
• Sattva (Electric) — Order/Potential
• Rajas (Magnetic) — Action/Motion  
• Propagation — Information transfer

This is why EM waves are TRANSVERSE, not longitudinal!
```

### 3.3.2 Mathematical Expression

```
Maxwell's equations encode this orthogonality:

∇ × E = -∂B/∂t    (Sattva rotation creates Rajas)
∇ × B = μ₀ε₀∂E/∂t  (Rajas rotation creates Sattva)

The curl operator (∇×) REQUIRES orthogonality.
This isn't arbitrary — it's Guna geometry.
```

## 3.4 Photon Properties Explained

### 3.4.1 Why Massless

```
MASS = TAMAS CONTENT:
=====================

Gravity paper showed: Mass ∝ Tamas

Photon composition:
• Rajas: HIGH (oscillating action)
• Sattva: HIGH (structured wave)
• Tamas: ZERO (no inertia)

Therefore: Photon mass = 0

E = hf (energy from frequency, not mass)
p = h/λ (momentum from wavelength, not mass)
```

### 3.4.2 Why Speed = c

```
WITH NO TAMAS (INERTIA):
=======================

Objects with mass (Tamas) travel < c
More mass = more Tamas = more resistance to motion

Photon has ZERO Tamas:
• No resistance to motion
• Travels at maximum possible speed
• c = architecture limit

Nothing can exceed c because:
• Can't process faster than 1 tick
• Can't render smaller than 1 pixel
• c is the simulation's bandwidth limit
```

## 3.5 ε₀ and μ₀ as Architecture Constants

### 3.5.1 Permittivity of Free Space

```
ε₀ = 8.854 × 10⁻¹² F/m

INTERPRETATION:
• How easily Sattva (electric field) propagates through Akasha
• "Dielectric constant of empty space"
• Measures Akasha's receptivity to Sattva
```

### 3.5.2 Permeability of Free Space

```
μ₀ = 4π × 10⁻⁷ H/m

INTERPRETATION:
• How easily Rajas (magnetic field) propagates through Akasha
• "Magnetic constant of empty space"
• Measures Akasha's receptivity to Rajas
```

### 3.5.3 Their Relationship

```
c = 1/√(μ₀ε₀)

MEANING:
The speed of light is determined by:
• How easily Akasha accepts Sattva (ε₀)
• How easily Akasha accepts Rajas (μ₀)
• Their geometric mean determines c

This is why c is constant — Akasha properties are uniform!
