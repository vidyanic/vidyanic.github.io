## 11.1 Summary of Findings

This paper has demonstrated that electromagnetism is the physical manifestation of Rajas-Sattva Guna (गुण) interaction within the Backend Framework:

### 11.1.1 Core Findings

1. **Electric Field = Sattva (सत्त्व)**
   - Represents order, potential, structure
   - Can exist statically (charges)
   - Creates potential energy

2. **Magnetic Field = Rajas (रजस्)**
   - Represents action, motion, dynamics
   - Requires movement (no static monopoles)
   - Creates kinetic effects

3. **Photon = Pure Rajas-Sattva**
   - Zero Tamas (तमस्) = massless
   - Maximum speed = c
   - Information carrier

4. **c = 1 pixel / 1 tick**
   - Speed of light is architecture, not velocity
   - Planck length / Planck time = c exactly
   - Explains constancy, maximum, invariance

## 11.2 Key Equations

```
MAXWELL-GUNA CORRESPONDENCE:
============================

∇ · E = ρ/ε₀         ->    Sattva diverges from sources
∇ · B = 0            ->    Rajas is cyclic (no monopoles)
∇ × E = -∂B/∂t       ->    Rajas change creates Sattva rotation
∇ × B = μ₀J + μ₀ε₀∂E/∂t  ->  Sattva change creates Rajas rotation

c = l_P / t_P = 1 pixel / 1 tick = 299,792,458 m/s
```

## 11.4 Implications

### 11.4.1 For Physics

- c constancy is explained, not postulated
- E ⊥ B geometry follows from Guna nature
- Photon properties derive from Guna composition
- EM constants are architecture parameters

### 11.4.2 For Information Theory

- Light IS information transfer
- EM is the universe's data bus
- All observation mediated by photons
- Reality = information at base

### 11.4.3 For Backend Framework

- Completes Guna-Force mapping (with Gravity paper)
- Unified understanding of physical forces
- Predicts Strong/Weak force characteristics

---

## 11.5 Limitations

1. Does not derive exact numerical constants
2. Strong/Weak forces need separate treatment
3. Quantum gravity still unaddressed
4. Fine structure constant unexplained

---

## 11.6 Future Work

### Immediate

1. Map Strong force to Sattva-Tamas
2. Map Weak force to Guna transformation
3. Derive α ≈ 1/137 from architecture

### Long-term

1. Unify all forces in Guna framework
2. Explain particle masses from Tamas
3. Develop quantum gravity in Backend terms

## 11.7 Final Statement

> **"सर्वं शक्तिमयं जगत्"**
> "The entire world is pervaded by Shakti (energy)."
> — Devi Bhagavatam

Electromagnetism is Shakti in its purest form — the dance of Rajas (action) and Sattva (order), free of Tamas (inertia). Light is not merely a physical phenomenon; it is the universe's information transfer mechanism, the rendering of reality to observers.

The speed of light is not a "velocity" in the ordinary sense — it is the aspect ratio of spacetime itself, the rate at which the simulation renders reality: exactly one pixel per tick.

This understanding transforms our view of electromagnetism from arbitrary equations to meaningful architecture, from "how" to "why".

## 11.8 Closing Quote

> **"तमसो मा ज्योतिर्गमय"**
> "Tamaso ma jyotirgamaya"
> "Lead me from darkness (Tamas) to light (Jyoti)"
> — Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 1.3.28

Light (Jyoti/ज्योति) is the opposite of darkness (Tamas/तमस्). 
Electromagnetism IS the path from Tamas to Sattva.
Understanding this is understanding reality itself.
