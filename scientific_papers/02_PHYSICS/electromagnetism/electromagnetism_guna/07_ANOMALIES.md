# 7. ANOMALIES & EDGE CASES

## 7.1 Potential Challenges to Framework

### 7.1.1 Why No Magnetic Monopoles?

**Challenge:** If E and B are symmetric in Maxwell's equations, why do electric monopoles (charges) exist but magnetic monopoles don't?

**Backend Resolution:**
```
SATTVA (Electric):
===================
• Can accumulate and be stored
• Static existence possible
• Creates structure/order
• Monopoles = concentrated Sattva

RAJAS (Magnetic):
=================
• Must be in motion
• Cannot be static
• Cyclic by nature
• No monopoles = Rajas is always flowing

ANALOGY:
A river (Rajas) has no "source point" in the same way a lake (Sattva) does.
Rajas is always moving, always cyclic.
```

### 7.1.2 Virtual Photons in QED

**Challenge:** Virtual photons can be "off-shell" (not satisfying E² = p²c² + m²c⁴). How does this fit?

**Backend Resolution:**
```
VIRTUAL PARTICLES:
===================
• Exist for Δt < ℏ/ΔE (Heisenberg)
• Not directly observed
• Mediate interactions

GUNA INTERPRETATION:
• Virtual photons = potential Rajas-Sattva
• Not fully "rendered" (exist in Avyakta)
• Only manifest when observed
• This is consistent with Maya rendering
```

### 7.1.3 Why This Specific c Value?

**Challenge:** Why is c = 299,792,458 m/s and not some other value?

**Backend Resolution:**
```
c = l_P / t_P

The question becomes:
Why is Planck length this size?
Why is Planck time this duration?

ANSWER:
These are determined by:
• G (gravitational constant) — Tamas strength
• ℏ (reduced Planck constant) — quantum scale
• c itself (circular, but...)

The specific values are ARCHITECTURE CHOICES.
Just as a game designer chooses resolution.
Could be different in other Brahmandas.

## 7.2 Historical Anomalies Explained

### 7.2.1 Aether Concept

**Historical View:** Light needs a medium (aether) to propagate.

**Michelson-Morley (1887):** No aether detected.

**Backend Resolution:**
```
AKASHA (आकाश) IS THE "AETHER":
================================

BUT:
• Akasha is not a physical substance
• It's the substrate of space itself
• It doesn't "move" relative to anything
• That's why MM found no drift

Akasha = The canvas, not paint on the canvas
Light propagates through Akasha
But Akasha isn't a "thing" you can measure motion relative to
```

### 7.2.2 Ultraviolet Catastrophe

**Historical Problem:** Classical EM predicted infinite energy at high frequencies.

**Resolution (Planck):** Energy is quantized: E = hf

**Backend Resolution:**
```
QUANTIZATION = RENDERING LIMIT:
===============================

Energy can't be infinitely small because:
• Planck length = minimum pixel
• Planck time = minimum tick
• Planck energy = minimum energy quantum

Reality is DIGITAL, not analog.
Infinite subdivision is impossible.
```

## 7.3 Unexplained Phenomena

### 7.3.1 Fine Structure Constant

```
α = e²/(4πε₀ℏc) ≈ 1/137.036

WHY THIS VALUE?

Current physics: Unknown

Backend speculation:
• α relates charge to EM strength
• May involve the 9:7 Dvipa-Samudra ratio
• Or the 81-grid architecture
• Further research needed
```

### 7.3.2 Charge Quantization

```
WHY IS CHARGE QUANTIZED?

e = 1.602 × 10⁻¹⁹ C

All charges are integer multiples of e (or e/3 for quarks).

Backend speculation:
• Sattva comes in discrete "packets"
• Minimum Sattva unit = e
• Like pixels, charge is digital
```

## 7.4 Framework Limitations

| Limitation | Description | Status |
|------------|-------------|--------|
| QCD (Strong force) | Not fully mapped to Gunas | Open |
| Weak force | Mixed Guna, complex | Open |
| Dark energy | Repulsive, unclear Guna | Separate paper |
| Quantum gravity | Not yet unified | Open |

## 7.5 Predictions for Future Testing

| Prediction | If Found | If Not Found |
|------------|----------|--------------|
| Magnetic monopoles | Revise Rajas model | Framework confirmed |
| Massive photons | Revise zero-Tamas | Framework confirmed |
| Variable c | Revise architecture | Framework confirmed |
| Longitudinal EM | Revise geometry | Framework confirmed |

**Current status:** All predictions confirmed (no anomalies found).
