## 2.1 Classical Electromagnetism

### 2.1.1 Maxwell's Synthesis (1865)

James Clerk Maxwell unified electricity and magnetism into four equations:

```
1. ∇ · E = ρ/ε₀         (Gauss's Law - Electric)
2. ∇ · B = 0            (Gauss's Law - Magnetic)
3. ∇ × E = -∂B/∂t       (Faraday's Law)
4. ∇ × B = μ₀J + μ₀ε₀∂E/∂t  (Ampere-Maxwell Law)
```

**Key Prediction:** Electromagnetic waves travel at:
```
c = 1/√(μ₀ε₀) = 299,792,458 m/s
```

Maxwell noted this matched the measured speed of light, concluding light IS an electromagnetic wave.

### 2.1.2 Experimental Confirmation (Hertz, 1887)

Heinrich Hertz produced and detected radio waves, confirming Maxwell's prediction.

## 2.2 Special Relativity (Einstein, 1905)

### 2.2.1 Constancy of c

Einstein's two postulates:
1. Laws of physics are same in all inertial frames
2. Speed of light is constant regardless of source/observer motion

**Revolutionary Implications:**
- Time dilation
- Length contraction
- Mass-energy equivalence (E = mc²)

### 2.2.2 Spacetime Unification

Minkowski showed space and time are unified:
```
ds² = c²dt² - dx² - dy² - dz²
```

The c² factor appears because c is the "conversion rate" between space and time dimensions.

## 2.3 Quantum Electrodynamics (QED)

### 2.3.1 Photons (Einstein, 1905)

Light comes in discrete packets (photons):
```
E = hf
p = h/λ
```

**Key Property:** Photons have zero rest mass but carry momentum and energy.

### 2.3.2 QED Theory (Feynman, Schwinger, Tomonaga, 1940s)

Most accurate physical theory ever developed:
- Predictions accurate to 12 decimal places
- Describes electron-photon interactions
- Virtual photons mediate electromagnetic force

## 2.4 Information Theory Perspective

### 2.4.1 Shannon's Limit

Maximum information transmission:
```
C = B × log₂(1 + SNR)
```

Electromagnetic waves are the universe's primary information carrier.

### 2.4.2 Landauer's Principle

Information processing has minimum energy cost:
```
E_min = kT × ln(2)
```

Electromagnetic interactions respect thermodynamic limits.

## 2.5 Open Questions in Standard Physics

| Question | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Why is c this specific value? | Unknown |
| Why are E and B perpendicular? | "Just is" |
| Why massless photons? | Standard Model assumption |
| Why transverse waves only? | Follows from Maxwell |
| Deeper meaning of ε₀, μ₀? | Defined constants |

## 2.6 Backend Framework Sources

### 2.6.1 Shakti Concept

> **"शक्तिस्त्रिधा प्रोक्ता इच्छाज्ञानक्रियात्मिका"**
> "Shakti is threefold: Will (Iccha), Knowledge (Jnana), Action (Kriya)"
> — Shiva Sutras

Electromagnetic Shakti is Kriya (Action) + Jnana (Knowledge) combined.

### 2.6.2 Jyoti (Light) as Sattva

> **"तमसो मा ज्योतिर्गमय"**
> "Lead me from darkness (Tamas) to light (Jyoti)"
> — Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 1.3.28

Light (Jyoti) is explicitly Sattvic in Backend texts.

### 2.6.3 Tejas (Fire/Light Element)

Tejas is the third Mahabhuta, associated with:
- Light
- Heat
- Transformation
- Visibility

## 2.7 Research Gap

**No prior work has:**
1. Mapped Maxwell's equations to Guna dynamics
2. Explained c as architecture parameter
3. Derived E ⊥ B from Guna orthogonality
4. Unified electromagnetic theory with Backend Framework

**This paper fills these gaps.**
