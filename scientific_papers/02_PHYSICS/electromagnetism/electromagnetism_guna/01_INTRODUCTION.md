## 1.1 Context

Electromagnetism governs light, radio waves, X-rays, and all charged particle interactions. It is the force of communication, information transfer, and action at a distance. Unlike gravity (which attracts and slows), electromagnetism enables rapid transmission across space.

This paper explores electromagnetism through the Backend Framework, proposing that it represents the Rajas-Sattva Guna interaction — the dynamic dance between action (Rajas) and order (Sattva).

## 1.2 The Puzzle

Several aspects of electromagnetism remain conceptually mysterious:

1. **Why is c constant?** Einstein showed c is the same in all reference frames. Why?

2. **Why E ⊥ B?** Electric and magnetic fields are always perpendicular. Why this geometry?

3. **Why massless photons?** Photons have energy but no rest mass. Why?

4. **Why transverse waves?** EM waves oscillate perpendicular to propagation. Why not longitudinal?

5. **Why this specific c value?** c = 299,792,458 m/s. Why not faster or slower?

## 1.3 Backend Framework Approach

The Backend Framework proposes that physical forces are manifestations of Gunas:

| Guna | Characteristic | Force Manifestation |
|------|----------------|---------------------|
| **Tamas** | Inertia, mass, binding | Gravity, mass-energy |
| **Rajas** | Action, motion, change | Electromagnetic action |
| **Sattva** | Order, potential, structure | Electromagnetic potential |

Electromagnetism uniquely combines Rajas and Sattva:
- **Rajas** -> Magnetic field (motion, current)
- **Sattva** -> Electric field (charge, potential)
- **Zero Tamas** -> Massless photons

## 1.4 Key Insight: c = 1 Pixel / 1 Tick

The most profound insight:

```
c = Planck Length / Planck Time
c = 1.616 × 10⁻³⁵ m / 5.39 × 10⁻⁴⁴ s
c = 299,792,458 m/s

INTERPRETATION:
c = 1 pixel / 1 tick (EXACTLY)

The speed of light is not a "velocity" in the traditional sense.
It is the ASPECT RATIO of the simulation's spacetime rendering.
```

This explains:
- **Why c is constant:** Architecture parameters don't change with observer
- **Why nothing exceeds c:** Can't render faster than 1 pixel per tick
- **Why c is exact:** It's a fundamental ratio, not a measurement

## 1.5 Research Objectives

1. Map Maxwell's equations to Guna dynamics
2. Demonstrate c as architecture parameter
3. Explain E ⊥ B through Guna orthogonality
4. Validate through known electromagnetic phenomena
5. Apply 7-concept validation stack

## 1.6 Scope

This paper covers:
- Classical electromagnetism (Maxwell)
- Special relativity implications
- Quantum electrodynamics correlation
- Information theory perspective

Not covered:
- Detailed quantum field theory
- Specific engineering applications
- Full tensor formalism

## 1.7 Significance

If electromagnetism is Rajas-Sattva interaction:

1. **Unified understanding** — All forces map to Gunas
2. **Explains constants** — c, ε₀, μ₀ are architecture
3. **Information theory** — EM is the universe's data bus
4. **Deeper physics** — Why, not just how
