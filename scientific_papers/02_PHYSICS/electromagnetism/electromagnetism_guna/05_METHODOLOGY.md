2. CONSTANT ANALYSIS
   Analyze c, ε₀, μ₀ as architecture parameters

3. PHENOMENON VALIDATION
   Check if known EM phenomena fit the framework

4. 7-CONCEPT VALIDATION
   Apply standard validation stack

5. PREDICTION TESTING
   Verify testable predictions against experiments

## 5.2 Structural Mapping Method

### 5.2.1 Maxwell -> Guna Translation

| Maxwell Element | Guna Element | Correspondence |
|-----------------|--------------|----------------|
| E (Electric field) | Sattva-Kshetra | Potential, order |
| B (Magnetic field) | Rajas-Kshetra | Action, motion |
| ρ (charge density) | Sattva source | Order accumulation |
| J (current density) | Rajas flow | Action stream |
| ∂/∂t (time derivative) | Kala change | Temporal evolution |
| ∇× (curl) | Guna rotation | Quality conversion |
| ∇· (divergence) | Guna emanation | Source/sink |

### 5.2.2 Equation-by-Equation Analysis

```
EQUATION 1: ∇ · E = ρ/ε₀
MEANING: Electric field diverges from charge
GUNA: Sattva emanates from Sattva sources

EQUATION 2: ∇ · B = 0
MEANING: Magnetic field has no sources
GUNA: Rajas is cyclic (no monopoles)

EQUATION 3: ∇ × E = -∂B/∂t
MEANING: Changing B creates curling E
GUNA: Rajas change induces Sattva rotation

EQUATION 4: ∇ × B = μ₀J + μ₀ε₀∂E/∂t
MEANING: Current or changing E creates curling B
GUNA: Rajas flow or Sattva change induces Rajas rotation

## 5.3 Constant Analysis Method

### 5.3.1 Speed of Light

```
ANALYSIS:
=========

c = 1/√(μ₀ε₀)

STEP 1: Express in Planck units
c = l_P / t_P

STEP 2: Interpret
l_P = minimum distance = 1 pixel
t_P = minimum time = 1 tick
c = 1 pixel / 1 tick

STEP 3: Verify
c = 1.616×10⁻³⁵ m / 5.39×10⁻⁴⁴ s = 299,792,458 m/s ✓

CONCLUSION: c is architecture aspect ratio
```

### 5.3.2 Permittivity and Permeability

```
ε₀ = Akasha's Sattva receptivity
μ₀ = Akasha's Rajas receptivity

Since Akasha is uniform (same everywhere in space):
• ε₀ is constant
• μ₀ is constant
• c = 1/√(μ₀ε₀) is constant
```

## 5.4 Phenomenon Validation Method

### 5.4.1 Known Phenomena Checklist

| Phenomenon | Explanation Required |
|------------|---------------------|
| Static electricity | Sattva accumulation |
| Magnetism | Rajas from motion |
| Induction | Rajas-Sattva conversion |
| Radio waves | Low-frequency oscillation |
| Light | Medium-frequency oscillation |
| X-rays | High-frequency oscillation |
| Photon properties | Zero-Tamas particle |

### 5.4.2 Anomaly Identification

Look for cases that DON'T fit:
- Magnetic monopoles (if found)
- Massive photons (if found)
- Variable c (if found)
- Longitudinal EM waves (if found)

## 5.5 7-Concept Validation Stack

| Concept | Test Question | Method |
|---------|---------------|--------|
| **Conservation** | Is energy conserved in EM? | Poynting vector |
| **Entropy** | Does disorder increase? | Information theory |
| **Fractal** | Same pattern at all scales? | Radio -> X-ray |
| **Karma** | Action = reaction? | Newton's 3rd for charges |
| **Observer** | Does observation matter? | QED experiments |
| **Cycles** | Is there periodicity? | Wave nature |
| **Gunas** | Classifiable as S/R/T? | This paper's thesis |
