|   • Everything vibrates                                                  |
|   • Sound is structured vibration                                        |
|   • Matter is crystallized sound                                         |
|   • Light is rapid vibration                                             |

|   • Disease = Frequency disruption                                       |
|   • Healing = Correct frequency application                              |

## 11.3 Key Equations

```
SOUND CREATES FORM:
==================
Frequency -> Pattern (Cymatics)

RESONANCE HEALS:
===============
f_external = f_natural -> Maximum response

GUNA CLASSIFICATION:
===================
Sattvic sound: Harmonious, healing
Rajasic sound: Stimulating, energizing
Tamasic sound: Heavy, discordant
```

## 11.9 Final Statement

> **"नादब्रह्म परमं ज्योतिः"**
> "Sound-Absolute is the supreme light."
> — Nada Bindu Upanishad

Sound is not just waves in air. Sound is the fabric of reality. From the primordial OM to the song of your cells, vibration is everywhere.

Healing is not magic — it is physics. The physics of resonance, the physics of frequency, the physics of returning to harmony.

The universe is a symphony.
You are an instrument.
Health is being in tune.
Healing is returning to the song.
