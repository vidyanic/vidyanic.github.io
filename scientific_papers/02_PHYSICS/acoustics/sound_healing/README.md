|   SHABDA-BRAHMAN (शब्द-ब्रह्मन्):                                         |
|   ===============================                                         |
|   • Reality IS vibration                                                 |
|   • Sound creates form (Cymatics proves this)                            |
|   • Specific frequencies -> Specific effects                              |
|   • Healing = Restoring correct frequency                                |
|                                                                           |

|   1. NADA (नाद) — Primordial sound/vibration                             |
|   2. BINDU (बिन्दु) — Point of manifestation                             |
|   3. SHABDA (शब्द) — Differentiated sound                                |
|   4. RUPA (रूप) — Form arises from sound                                 |
|                                                                           |
|   "In the beginning was the Word" = "In the beginning was Shabda"        |

## 📊 HEALING FREQUENCIES

### Key Therapeutic Frequencies

| Frequency | Name | Effect | Backend |
|-----------|------|--------|---------|
| **174 Hz** | Foundation | Pain reduction | Muladhara |
| **285 Hz** | Tissue | Tissue repair | Cells |
| **396 Hz** | Liberation | Fear release | Muladhara |
| **417 Hz** | Change | Trauma clearing | Svadhisthana |
| **432 Hz** | Cosmic | Harmony, peace | Universal tuning |
| **528 Hz** | Miracle | DNA repair | Anahata |
| **639 Hz** | Connection | Relationships | Heart |
| **741 Hz** | Expression | Self-expression | Vishuddha |
| **852 Hz** | Intuition | Third eye | Ajna |
| **963 Hz** | Divine | Enlightenment | Sahasrara |

### Cymatics Proof

```
CYMATICS = SOUND CREATES FORM:
==============================

• Sand/water on plate + frequency = PATTERN
• Specific frequency = Specific pattern
• Higher frequency = More complex pattern
• This is VISIBLE proof: Sound -> Form

Hans Jenny documented thousands of patterns.
Sound doesn't just affect matter — it SHAPES it.
```

## 🎵 OM (AUM) ANALYSIS

```
OM = PRIMORDIAL SOUND:
=====================

FREQUENCY: ~136.1 Hz (Earth year frequency)
COMPONENTS: A-U-M + Silence

A (अ) = Creation (Brahma)
U (उ) = Preservation (Vishnu)
M (म) = Dissolution (Shiva)
Silence = Turiya (Beyond)

SCIENTIFIC CORRELATES:
• 136.1 Hz = Earth's orbital frequency
• EEG changes during OM chanting
• Vagal tone improvement
• Brain coherence increase
```

## 🔬 SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE

### Documented Effects

| Application | Finding | Evidence Level |
|-------------|---------|----------------|
| Music therapy | Pain reduction 30-40% | Strong |
| Vibroacoustic | Anxiety reduction | Moderate |
| OM chanting | Brain coherence | Documented |
| Binaural beats | Meditation enhancement | Moderate |
| Tibetan bowls | Stress reduction | Preliminary |

### Cellular Response

| Frequency Range | Cellular Effect | Research |
|-----------------|-----------------|----------|
| 40-100 Hz | Bone regeneration | Preliminary |
| 250-500 Hz | Protein synthesis | Theoretical |
| 528 Hz | DNA response | Preliminary |
