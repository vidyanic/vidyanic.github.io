# 2. Literature Review

## 2.1 Dark Matter Discovery

### 2.1.1 Zwicky's Observation (1933)

Fritz Zwicky studied the Coma galaxy cluster and found:

> "The average density of the Coma cluster would have to be 400 times greater than that derived from luminous matter alone."

### 2.1.2 Rubin's Rotation Curves (1970s)

Vera Rubin and Kent Ford measured galaxy rotation:

```
EXPECTED (Keplerian):
v(r) ∝ 1/√r (velocity decreases with distance)

OBSERVED:
v(r) ≈ constant (velocity stays flat)

IMPLICATION:
Massive invisible halo surrounds galaxies.
```

## 2.2 Dark Energy Discovery

### 2.2.1 Accelerating Expansion (1998)

Two independent teams discovered that Type Ia supernovae were fainter than expected:

> "The universe is not just expanding, it's accelerating."

**Key Papers:**
- Riess, A.G. et al. (1998). "Observational Evidence from Supernovae for an Accelerating Universe." *Astronomical Journal*, 116, 1009-1038.
- Perlmutter, S. et al. (1999). "Measurements of Ω and Λ from 42 High-Redshift Supernovae." *Astrophysical Journal*, 517, 565-586.

Both teams won the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics.

## 2.3 Gravitational Lensing Evidence

### 2.3.1 Bullet Cluster (2006)

The "Bullet Cluster" showed dark matter and visible matter separating during collision:

> "A direct empirical proof of the existence of dark matter."

## 2.4 Detection Experiments

### 2.4.1 Direct Detection

| Experiment | Location | Target | Result |
|------------|----------|--------|--------|
| XENON1T | Gran Sasso | Xenon | No detection |
| LUX | South Dakota | Xenon | No detection |
| PandaX | China | Xenon | No detection |
| CDMS | Soudan | Germanium | No detection |

### 2.4.2 Collider Searches

| Experiment | Collider | Target | Result |
|------------|----------|--------|--------|
| ATLAS | LHC | SUSY particles | None found |
| CMS | LHC | SUSY particles | None found |

**Status:** After decades and billions of dollars, no dark matter particle confirmed.

## 2.5 Theoretical Candidates

### 2.5.1 WIMPs (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles)

```
THEORY:
Heavy particles (~100 GeV) that interact via weak force.
Should be produced in early universe.
Should be detectable through nuclear recoil.

STATUS:
Not detected. Allowed mass range shrinking.
```

### 2.5.2 Axions

```
THEORY:
Very light particles (~10⁻⁵ eV).
Proposed to solve CP problem.
Would interact with magnetic fields.

STATUS:
ADMX and other searches ongoing. No detection yet.
```

### 2.5.3 MACHOs (Massive Astrophysical Compact Halo Objects)

```
THEORY:
Brown dwarfs, black holes, etc. too faint to see.

STATUS:
Microlensing surveys show insufficient MACHOs.
Can't explain all dark matter.
```

## 2.6 Alternative Theories

### 2.6.1 MOND (Modified Newtonian Dynamics)

Milgrom (1983) proposed modifying gravity at low accelerations:

```
At low a, gravity changes from F = ma to F = m × √(a × a₀)

WHERE:
a₀ ≈ 10⁻¹⁰ m/s² (threshold)
```

**Key Paper:**
- Milgrom, M. (1983). "A modification of the Newtonian dynamics as a possible alternative to the hidden mass hypothesis." *Astrophysical Journal*, 270, 365-370.

**Limitations:** Doesn't explain galaxy clusters, CMB, or Bullet Cluster.

### 2.6.2 Emergent Gravity (Verlinde)

Erik Verlinde proposed gravity emerges from information entropy:

> "Gravity is explained as an entropic force caused by changes in the information associated with the positions of material bodies."

**Key Paper:**
- Verlinde, E. (2011). "On the Origin of Gravity and the Laws of Newton." *Journal of High Energy Physics*, 2011(4), 29.

## 2.7 Cosmic Microwave Background

### 2.7.1 Planck Mission Results

Precision measurements of CMB revealed:

| Component | Percentage |
|-----------|------------|
| Dark energy | 68.3% |
| Dark matter | 26.8% |
| Ordinary matter | 4.9% |

**Key Paper:**
- Planck Collaboration (2020). "Planck 2018 results. VI. Cosmological parameters." *Astronomy & Astrophysics*, 641, A6.

## 2.8 Summary: The State of the Field

```
KNOWN:
✓ Dark matter exists (gravitational evidence)
✓ Dark energy exists (expansion acceleration)
✓ Together they dominate the universe (95%)

UNKNOWN:
✗ What dark matter IS (no particle found)
✗ What dark energy IS (cosmological constant?)
✗ Why detection fails despite 90 years of effort
```

### Research Gap

This paper addresses: **Why does dark matter evade detection while gravitating normally?**

Our hypothesis: It's not in our frequency band. It's rendering in adjacent Lokas.
