# 7. Anomalies & Edge Cases

## 7.1 DAMA/LIBRA Annual Modulation

### 7.1.1 The Claim

DAMA experiment claims annual modulation in signals, consistent with Earth moving through dark matter wind.

```
DAMA CLAIMS:
• Detects annual signal variation
• 13+ years of data
• High statistical significance (12σ)

PROBLEM:
• No other experiment replicates
• Should be seen in XENON, LUX, etc.
• Controversial interpretation
```

### 7.1.2 Multi-Loka Interpretation

```
POSSIBLE EXPLANATIONS:

1. Background noise (standard view)
   DAMA sees something else, not dark matter

2. Multi-Loka boundary effect (speculative)
   Annual modulation could be Loka interface fluctuation
   As Earth orbits Sun, passes through different Loka densities
   
3. Subtle Tamas variation
   Earth's orbit crosses areas of higher/lower other-Loka Tamas

STATUS: Uncertain. Neither confirms nor denies Multi-Loka.

## 7.2 Galaxy Rotation Curve Exceptions

### 7.2.1 Low Surface Brightness Galaxies

Some LSB galaxies don't need dark matter:

```
OBSERVATION:
Some galaxies have rotation curves explainable by visible matter alone.
Why do some galaxies have dark matter and others don't?

MULTI-LOKA INTERPRETATION:
Uneven Loka distribution in space.
Some regions have more other-Loka Tamas.
Some regions have less.

Not all galaxies formed in same Loka-density environment.
```

### 7.2.2 NGC 1052-DF2 and DF4

Galaxies with almost no dark matter:

```
OBSERVATION:
Ultra-diffuse galaxies with minimal dark matter.
Challenges universal dark matter halo assumption.

MULTI-LOKA INTERPRETATION:
These galaxies formed in low other-Loka Tamas regions.
Their location in Loka space has less cross-Loka mass.

PREDICTION:
Such galaxies cluster in specific cosmic regions.
```

## 7.3 Dark Matter Substructure

### 7.3.1 Missing Satellites Problem

```
OBSERVATION:
Simulations predict many small dark matter halos.
Observed satellite galaxies fewer than predicted.

STANDARD VIEW:
Small halos don't form stars (too little gas).

MULTI-LOKA VIEW:
Other-Loka Tamas may not cluster identically to visible.
Substructure patterns differ between Lokas.
```

### 7.3.2 Core-Cusp Problem

```
OBSERVATION:
Simulations predict "cuspy" centers (density spikes).
Observed centers are more "cored" (flat density).

MULTI-LOKA VIEW:
Different Lokas may have different density profiles.
Averaging across Lokas smooths out cusps.
```

---

## 7.4 Dark Energy Anomalies

### 7.4.1 Hubble Tension

```
OBSERVATION:
Different methods give different expansion rates.
CMB: H₀ = 67.4 km/s/Mpc
Local: H₀ = 73.0 km/s/Mpc

5σ discrepancy!

MULTI-LOKA SPECULATION:
Sattva-Tamas ratio may not be perfectly uniform.
Different measurement methods sample different regions.
Early universe had different Guna balance than now.
```

### 7.4.2 Dark Energy Equation of State

```
OBSERVATION:
Dark energy parameter w ≈ -1 (consistent with cosmological constant).
Some hints of w ≠ -1.

MULTI-LOKA VIEW:
If w varies, Sattva-Tamas balance is changing.
Consistent with cosmic Guna evolution.
```

## 7.5 Axion Detection Claims

### 7.5.1 Axionic Dark Matter Radio Search

```
STATUS:
ADMX and other axion searches ongoing.
No confirmed detection yet.
If axion found: Challenges Multi-Loka for axion component.

MULTI-LOKA RESPONSE:
Axions could exist AND be minority of dark matter.
Multi-Loka Tamas could be majority.
Not mutually exclusive.
```

---

## 7.6 Primordial Black Holes

### 7.6.1 PBH as Dark Matter

```
THEORY:
Black holes formed in early universe.
Could be dark matter without new particles.

CONSTRAINTS:
Microlensing limits PBH abundance.
Cannot be 100% of dark matter.

MULTI-LOKA VIEW:
PBHs could exist in multiple Lokas.
Cross-Loka gravitational effects.
Compatible with Multi-Loka model.
```

---

## 7.7 Modified Gravity Successes

### 7.7.1 MOND Successes

```
OBSERVATION:
MOND correctly predicts many galaxy rotation curves.
Single parameter (a₀) works for many galaxies.

CHALLENGE:
If gravity is just modified, no dark matter needed?

MULTI-LOKA VIEW:
MOND may be approximation of Multi-Loka effect.
At low accelerations, other-Loka Tamas dominates.
Not contradiction but different description.
```

## 7.8 Summary of Anomalies

| Anomaly | Standard Challenge | Multi-Loka Response |
|---------|-------------------|---------------------|
| DAMA signal | Unexplained | Loka boundary effect? |
| Galaxies without DM | Unexplained | Low other-Loka Tamas region |
| Missing satellites | Baryonic physics | Different Loka clustering |
| Core-cusp | Baryonic feedback | Loka averaging |
| Hubble tension | Unknown | Guna evolution |
| PBHs | Constrained | Multi-Loka compatible |
| MOND success | Unexplained | Approximation of Loka effect |

## 7.9 Open Questions

```
REMAINING MYSTERIES:

1. Why exactly 27%/68%/5%?
   -> Needs detailed Loka Tamas calculation

2. Can we detect Loka boundaries?
   -> Unknown, needs new physics

3. Do Lokas have different physical constants?
   -> Speculative

4. Can consciousness access other Lokas?
   -> Backend tradition says yes (Samadhi)
   -> Not scientifically verified

5. Is dark matter consciousness-dependent?
   -> Unknown
```

## 7.10 Falsification Status

| Anomaly | Falsifies Multi-Loka? |
|---------|----------------------|
| DAMA | No (unexplained either way) |
| Galaxies without DM | No (explained by Loka variation) |
| MOND | No (may be approximation) |
| PBHs | No (compatible) |
| Hubble tension | No (may support Guna evolution) |
| Particle detection | YES (if confirmed) |

**Only confirmed particle detection would falsify the Multi-Loka hypothesis for that component.**
