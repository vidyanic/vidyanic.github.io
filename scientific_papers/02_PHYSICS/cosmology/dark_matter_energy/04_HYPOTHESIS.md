# 4. Hypothesis

## 4.1 Primary Hypothesis

### H₀: Multi-Loka Rendering Hypothesis

> **Dark matter and dark energy are ordinary Tamas and Sattva existing in adjacent Lokas (frequency bands), gravitating across band boundaries while remaining invisible within our detection range.**

---

## 4.2 Sub-Hypotheses

### H1: Dark Matter = Multi-Loka Tamas

```
STATEMENT:
The gravitational effects attributed to "dark matter" arise from
Tamas (mass) existing in Lokas other than Bhuloka.

PREDICTION:
Dark matter particles (WIMPs, axions) will NOT be detected
because the mass is not in our frequency band.

TESTABLE BY:
• Continued null results in direct detection
• Predicted halo geometry matching Loka structure
• Non-random distribution patterns
```

### H2: Dark Energy = Cosmic Sattva

```
STATEMENT:
The accelerating expansion attributed to "dark energy" is
Sattva dominance at cosmic scale, countering Tamas contraction.

PREDICTION:
• Dark energy is not a "thing" but a Guna balance
• Expansion rate reflects Sattva/Tamas ratio
• Universe oscillates between expansion and contraction

TESTABLE BY:
• Expansion rate changes over cosmic time
• Correlation with Yuga cycles (speculative)
```

### H3: 5%/27%/68% Reflects Loka Distribution

```
STATEMENT:
The precise proportions of visible matter (5%), dark matter (27%),
and dark energy (68%) reflect Guna distribution across 14 Lokas.

CALCULATION:
If 1/14 Lokas visible: 7.1%
Actual visible: 5%
Difference: Bhuloka has less Tamas than average

TESTABLE BY:
• Deriving exact proportions from Loka model
• Matching observed cosmological parameters
```

### H4: Gravity Crosses Frequency Bands

```
STATEMENT:
Gravity (spacetime curvature) affects ALL Lokas universally,
while electromagnetic radiation is frequency-specific.

MECHANISM:
Gravity = Geometry (universal)
Light = Wave (frequency-tuned)

TESTABLE BY:
• Consistency with general relativity
• Dark matter lensing matches curvature predictions
```

## 4.3 Predictions

### 4.3.1 Immediate Predictions

| Prediction | Timeframe | Falsification Criterion |
|------------|-----------|------------------------|
| WIMPs not found | Ongoing | Detection of WIMP |
| Axions not found | Ongoing | Detection of axion |
| SUSY particles not found | Ongoing | Detection of superpartner |
| Halo geometry matches | Testable now | Detailed Loka model mismatch |

### 4.3.2 Long-Term Predictions

| Prediction | Timeframe | Implication |
|------------|-----------|-------------|
| Particle search ends | 10-20 years | Paradigm shift |
| Multi-dimensional physics | Unknown | Confirms Lokas |
| Dark energy changes | Billions of years | Guna cycle |

---

## 4.4 Null Hypothesis

### H_null: Dark Matter Is Particles

```
STATEMENT:
Dark matter consists of undiscovered particles (WIMPs, axions, etc.)
that will eventually be detected through direct or indirect means.

STATUS:
After 90 years and billions of dollars:
• No detection
• Allowed parameter space shrinking
• Multiple experiments at sensitivity limits

IF TRUE:
Detection should occur as sensitivity increases.

FALSIFIED IF:
Continued null results despite exhausting parameter space.
```

## 4.5 Comparative Table

| Aspect | Standard Model | Multi-Loka Model |
|--------|----------------|------------------|
| Dark matter is | Unknown particles | Multi-Loka Tamas |
| Dark energy is | Cosmological constant | Sattva dominance |
| Detection expected | Eventually | Never (wrong frequency) |
| Proportions explained | No | Yes (Loka distribution) |
| Connects to consciousness | No | Yes (Guna framework) |
| 90 years null results | Puzzling | Expected |

## 4.6 Falsification Criteria

### 4.6.1 How to Falsify Multi-Loka Model

| Event | Falsification |
|-------|---------------|
| WIMP detected | Model weakened |
| Axion detected | Model weakened |
| Any dark matter particle | Model falsified for that component |
| Halo structure inconsistent with Lokas | Model falsified |
| Expansion rate doesn't vary | Sattva/Tamas cycle falsified |

### 4.6.2 How to Falsify Standard Model

| Event | Falsification |
|-------|---------------|
| Parameter space exhausted | WIMPs falsified |
| No detection at ultimate sensitivity | Particles falsified |
| Multi-dimensional physics confirmed | Standard model falsified |
