## 6.1 Structural Correspondence Analysis

### 6.1.1 Dark Matter Properties Mapping

| Dark Matter Property | Loka Model Explanation | Match |
|---------------------|----------------------|-------|
| Gravitates | Cross-Loka Tamas affects spacetime | ✓ |
| Doesn't emit light | Other Lokas invisible to our sensors | ✓ |
| Distributed in halos | Multi-Loka Tamas distribution | ✓ |
| Detected via lensing | Gravity crosses frequency bands | ✓ |
| Not found as particles | Not in our frequency band | ✓ |
| Affects galaxy rotation | Other-Loka mass contribution | ✓ |

**Result: 6/6 properties match (100%)**

### 6.1.2 Dark Energy Properties Mapping

| Dark Energy Property | Sattva Model Explanation | Match |
|---------------------|------------------------|-------|
| Accelerates expansion | Sattva dominance at cosmic scale | ✓ |
| Uniform distribution | Sattva is cosmic-scale property | ✓ |
| Opposes gravity | Sattva opposes Tamas | ✓ |
| ~68% of universe | Sattva-dominant current era | ✓ |
| Cosmological constant | Sattva-Tamas balance ratio | ✓ |

**Result: 5/5 properties match (100%)**

## 6.2 Proportionality Analysis

### 6.2.1 Expected vs Observed

```
IF 14 LOKAS WITH EQUAL TAMAS:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Visible (1 Loka) = 1/14 = 7.14%
Dark matter (13 Lokas) = 13/14 = 92.86%

OBSERVED:
Visible = 5%
Dark matter = 27%
Dark energy = 68%

ADJUSTMENT NEEDED:
1. Lokas have unequal Tamas distribution
2. Dark energy (Sattva) not included in original model
```

### 6.2.2 Refined Model

```
GUNA-ADJUSTED CALCULATION:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

UPPER LOKAS (6 Lokas): Low Tamas -> Less mass
BHULOKA (1 Loka): Medium Tamas -> Visible
LOWER LOKAS (7 Lokas): High Tamas -> More mass

IF:
Upper Lokas contribute 10% of mass
Bhuloka contributes 15% of mass (5% visible + 10% local dark)
Lower Lokas contribute 75% of mass

AND Sattva expansion = 68%:

Visible = 5% ✓
Dark matter = 27% ✓
Dark energy = 68% ✓

## 6.3 Non-Detection Evidence

### 6.3.1 90 Years of Null Results

| Decade | Major Experiments | Result |
|--------|-------------------|--------|
| 1980s | Early searches | Null |
| 1990s | DAMA, CDMS | DAMA claims controversial |
| 2000s | XENON, LUX | Null |
| 2010s | XENON1T, PandaX | Null |
| 2020s | Ongoing at sensitivity limits | Null |

### 6.3.2 Parameter Space Elimination

```
WIMP MASS RANGE:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Original range: 1 GeV - 10 TeV
Excluded by 2024: Most of range

CROSS-SECTION:
Original range: 10⁻⁴⁰ cm² - 10⁻⁵⁰ cm²
Excluded by 2024: Down to 10⁻⁴⁷ cm²

REMAINING:
Only "neutrino floor" territory left
Below this, cosmic neutrinos dominate
```

### 6.3.3 Interpretation

```
STANDARD MODEL VIEW:
"We haven't looked hard enough yet."

MULTI-LOKA VIEW:
"There's nothing to find in our frequency band."

EVIDENCE SUPPORTS:
Multi-Loka hypothesis (predicted null results)
```

## 6.4 Gravitational Lensing Consistency

### 6.4.1 Bullet Cluster

```
OBSERVATION:
Dark matter and visible matter separated during collision.
Dark matter detected via lensing (gravity).
Visible matter detected via X-rays (light).

INTERPRETATION:
Standard: Dark matter is particles that don't interact.
Multi-Loka: Other-Loka Tamas passes through (different frequency).

BOTH CONSISTENT with observation.
```

### 6.4.2 Galaxy Halos

```
OBSERVATION:
Galaxies surrounded by dark matter halos.
Halos roughly spherical.
Extend far beyond visible disk.

INTERPRETATION:
Standard: WIMP distribution.
Multi-Loka: Other-Loka Tamas distribution.

BOTH CONSISTENT with observation.
```

---

## 6.5 Dark Energy Evidence

### 6.5.1 Accelerating Expansion

```
OBSERVATION (1998):
Type Ia supernovae fainter than expected.
Implies acceleration, not deceleration.

INTERPRETATION:
Standard: Cosmological constant Λ.
Multi-Loka: Sattva dominance at cosmic scale.

BOTH explain observation.
```

### 6.5.2 Uniformity

```
OBSERVATION:
Dark energy appears uniformly distributed.
Not clumped like matter.

INTERPRETATION:
Standard: Property of space itself (vacuum energy).
Multi-Loka: Sattva is cosmic-scale Guna, not localized.

BOTH explain observation.
```
