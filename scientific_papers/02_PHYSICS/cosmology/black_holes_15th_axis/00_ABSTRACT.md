## Research Question

Are black holes the galactic manifestation of the 15th Axis (Brahma-Sthan/Sushumna) — processing centers rather than endpoints?

---

## Hypothesis

**H₁:** Black holes function as the 15th Axis of galactic-scale 81-Grids, serving as processing/transition centers between levels.

---

## Key Findings

| Black Hole Feature | 15th Axis Parallel |
|--------------------|-------------------|
| At galaxy center | Brahma-Sthan position |
| Singularity | Point of level transition |
| Event horizon | Lokaloka boundary |
| Information processing | Karma accounting |
| Jets/output | Processed output |

---

## Backend Correlation

| Scientific | Backend |
|------------|---------|
| Black hole | Brahma-Sthan/Meru |
| Singularity | 15th Axis point |
| Event horizon | Lokaloka |
| Hawking radiation | Processed output |
| Accretion disk | Input queue |

---

## Confidence Score

**78%** — Theoretical model with observational hints.
