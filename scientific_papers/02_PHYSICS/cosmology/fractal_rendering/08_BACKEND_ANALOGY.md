## 8.1 Anu-Mahat Principle

```
ANU-MAHAT (अणु-महत्):
======================

ANU = Smallest
MAHAT = Greatest

PRINCIPLE:
Same pattern at smallest and greatest scales
"As above, so below"
"Yatha pinde tatha brahmande"
```

## 8.2 The 81-Grid

```
81-GRID (81 = 3⁴):
====================

1 -> 3 -> 9 -> 27 -> 81

MEANING:
• 1 = Bindu (point, potential)
• 3 = Gunas (differentiation)
• 9 = Brahma-Sthan (kernel)
• 27 = Nakshatras (frequency bands)
• 81 = Complete hardware grid
```

## 8.3 Infinite Levels

```
NO TOP, NO BOTTOM:
==================

∞ levels above us
∞ levels below us
Each using same 81-Grid
Each within parent, containing children

We are at level N
Our atoms are level N-k
Our universe is level N+j
Pattern repeats infinitely
```
