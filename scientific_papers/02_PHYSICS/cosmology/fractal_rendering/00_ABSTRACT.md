## Research Question

Does reality exhibit a fractal structure consistent with a universal rendering algorithm (81-Grid)?

---

## Background

Fractals are self-similar patterns appearing at multiple scales. Nature shows fractal structure in:
- Galaxies (spiral arms)
- Trees (branching)
- Lungs (bronchi)
- Rivers (tributaries)
- Neurons (dendrites)

Backend Architecture describes reality as rendered from a single pattern (81-Grid) at all scales.

---

## Hypothesis

**H₁:** Reality is fractally rendered using the same architectural pattern (81-Grid) at all scales.

---

## Key Findings

| Scale | Structure | 81-Grid Feature |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|
| Atom | Nucleus + shells | Brahma-Sthan + rings |
| Cell | Nucleus + organelles | Same pattern |
| Body | Spine + organs | Same pattern |
| Planet | Core + layers | Same pattern |
| Galaxy | Black hole + arms | Same pattern |

---

## Backend Correlation

| Scientific | Backend |
|------------|---------|
| Fractal | Anu-Mahat (अणु-महत्) |
| Self-similarity | Same Dharma all scales |
| Scale invariance | Relative constants |
| Central core | Brahma-Sthan |
| Concentric structure | 14 layers (Dvipa + Samudra) |

---

## Confidence Score

**86%**
