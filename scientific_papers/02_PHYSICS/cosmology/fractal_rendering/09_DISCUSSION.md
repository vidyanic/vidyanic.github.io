## 9.1 Summary

Reality exhibits fractal structure consistent with universal rendering:
- Same pattern at all scales
- 81-Grid architecture matches observations
- Central core, concentric layers, boundary — everywhere

---

## 9.2 Implications

### 9.2.1 For Physics

- Laws scale fractally
- Constants may be level-relative
- Unification may be fractal, not reductionist

### 9.2.2 For Cosmology

- No smallest or largest scale
- Universe is nested infinitely
- "Big Bang" is one level's Srishti

### 9.2.3 For You

- You contain universes (cells, atoms)
- You are within universes (planet, galaxy)
- Same pattern all the way
