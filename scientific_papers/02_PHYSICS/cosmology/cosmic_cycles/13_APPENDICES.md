## Appendix A: Yuga Duration Calculations

### A.1 Traditional Yuga Lengths

```
TRADITIONAL CALCULATION:
========================

Base Unit: 1 Deva Year = 360 Human Years

Satya Yuga: 4,800 Deva Years = 1,728,000 Human Years
Treta Yuga: 3,600 Deva Years = 1,296,000 Human Years
Dwapara Yuga: 2,400 Deva Years = 864,000 Human Years
Kali Yuga: 1,200 Deva Years = 432,000 Human Years

Total Mahayuga: 12,000 Deva Years = 4,320,000 Human Years

Ratio: 4:3:2:1 (exactly)
```

### A.2 Yukteswar Model

```
YUKTESWAR CALCULATION:
======================

Base Unit: 1 Yuga Year = 1 Human Year

Satya Yuga: 4,800 Years
Treta Yuga: 3,600 Years
Dwapara Yuga: 2,400 Years
Kali Yuga: 1,200 Years

Total Cycle: 12,000 Years (one direction)
Complete Cycle: 24,000 Years (ascending + descending)

This approximates the precessional period (25,920 years).
```

### A.3 Sandhya Calculation

```
SANDHYA (TRANSITION) PERIODS:
=============================

Each Yuga has:
- Sandhya (dawn): 10% of Yuga duration
- Core period: 80% of Yuga duration
- Sandhyamsha (dusk): 10% of Yuga duration

Example: Kali Yuga (432,000 years)
- Sandhya: 43,200 years
- Core: 345,600 years
- Sandhyamsha: 43,200 years
```

## Appendix B: Kalpa & Brahma Calculations

### B.1 Kalpa Structure

```
KALPA CALCULATION:
==================

1 Kalpa = 1,000 Mahayugas = 4,320,000,000 years
        = 14 Manvantaras + 15 Manvantara Sandhis

Each Manvantara = 71.428 Mahayugas
                = 308,571,428 years (approximately)

Each Manvantara Sandhi = 1 Satya Yuga
                       = 1,728,000 years
```

### B.2 Brahma Lifespan

```
BRAHMA LIFESPAN:
================

1 Brahma Day = 1 Kalpa = 4.32 billion years
1 Brahma Night = 1 Kalpa = 4.32 billion years
1 Brahma Year = 360 Brahma Days = 3,110,400,000,000 years
Brahma Lifespan = 100 Brahma Years = 311,040,000,000,000 years

Current Position (Vedic tradition):
- Day 1 of Year 51 of current Brahma
- 7th Manvantara (Vaivasvata)
- 28th Mahayuga of this Manvantara
- Kali Yuga of this Mahayuga
```

## Appendix C: Milankovitch Cycle Data

### C.1 Primary Cycles

```
MILANKOVITCH CYCLES:
====================

1. ECCENTRICITY
   Dominant periods: ~100,000 and ~413,000 years
   Cause: Gravitational effects of Jupiter and Saturn
   Effect: Changes in Earth-Sun distance (currently ~3%)

2. AXIAL TILT (Obliquity)
   Period: ~41,000 years
   Range: 22.1° to 24.5° (currently 23.4°)
   Effect: Seasonal intensity variation

3. PRECESSION
   Period: ~25,920 years (26,000 average)
   Cause: Gravitational torque on equatorial bulge
   Effect: Shifts which hemisphere faces Sun at perihelion
```

### C.2 Correlation with Ice Ages

| Cycle | Period | Ice Age Correlation |
|-------|--------|---------------------|
| Eccentricity | ~100K yrs | Strong (glacial/interglacial) |
| Obliquity | ~41K yrs | Moderate (temperature variance) |
| Precession | ~26K yrs | Strong (monsoon patterns) |

## Appendix E: Precessional Age Calculation

### E.1 Zodiacal Ages

```
ZODIACAL AGE CALCULATION:
=========================

Precessional cycle: 25,920 years
12 Zodiacal signs
Age duration: 25,920 / 12 = 2,160 years each

APPROXIMATE AGES:
Age of Leo: ~10,500 - 8,340 BCE
Age of Cancer: ~8,340 - 6,180 BCE
Age of Gemini: ~6,180 - 4,020 BCE
Age of Taurus: ~4,020 - 1,860 BCE
Age of Aries: ~1,860 BCE - 280 CE
Age of Pisces: ~280 CE - 2,440 CE
Age of Aquarius: ~2,440 CE - 4,600 CE

Note: Boundaries are approximate; transition periods exist.
Current position: Late Pisces / Early Aquarius cusp.

## Appendix F: Fractal Self-Similarity Table

### F.1 Cycle Pattern Comparison

| Scale | Satya-like | Treta-like | Dwapara-like | Kali-like |
|-------|------------|------------|--------------|-----------|
| **Day** | Morning | Afternoon | Evening | Night |
| **Year** | Spring | Summer | Autumn | Winter |
| **Life** | Childhood | Youth | Middle age | Old age |
| **Economy** | Recovery | Boom | Speculation | Bust |
| **Civilization** | Founding | Golden age | Decline | Collapse |
| **Yuga** | Satya | Treta | Dwapara | Kali |

### F.2 Self-Similarity Formula

```
FRACTAL VALIDATION:
===================

Pattern(n) ≈ Pattern(n±k) × ScaleFactor(k)

Where:
- n = reference scale level
- k = scale offset (positive = larger, negative = smaller)
- ScaleFactor = time ratio between scales

If pattern matches across 3+ scale levels:
Fractal self-similarity = CONFIRMED
