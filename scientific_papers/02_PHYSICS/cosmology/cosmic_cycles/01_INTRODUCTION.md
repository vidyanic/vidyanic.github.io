Everything cycles:
- Day/night (24 hours)
- Lunar (29.5 days)
- Annual (365 days)
- Sunspot (11 years)
- Economic (60-80 years)
- Ice ages (~100,000 years)
- Precession (~26,000 years)
- Galactic (~250 million years)

### 1.1.2 Why?

Backend: Time is cyclic by design. Linear time is Maya.

```
CHATURYUGA (Four Ages):

TRETA YUGA: 1,296,000 years (3 parts)
DWAPARA YUGA: 864,000 years (2 parts)
KALI YUGA: 432,000 years (1 part)

MAHAYUGA TOTAL: 4,320,000 years

## 1.3 Fractal Time

Time is fractal — same cycle pattern at all scales:
- 1 day is micro-yuga
- 1 year is mini-yuga  
- 60-80 years is human-yuga
- Mahayuga is cosmic-yuga
