## Research Question

Do cosmic cycles correspond to Backend Yuga mechanics?

---

## Hypothesis

**H₁:** Cosmic cycles (ice ages, precession, galactic rotation) are manifestations of Yuga mechanics at different scales.

---

## Key Findings

| Scientific Cycle | Period | Yuga Parallel |
|------------------|--------|---------------|
| Milankovitch | 100K, 41K, 26K years | Yuga sub-cycles |
| Precession | 25,920 years | Yuga transition |
| Galactic year | 225-250 million years | Kalpa-level cycle |
| 60-80 year | Human scale | Dharma frequency |
