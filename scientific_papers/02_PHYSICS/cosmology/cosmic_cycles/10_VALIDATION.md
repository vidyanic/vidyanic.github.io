## 10.2 Concept 1: Conservation

### Test
Is energy/information preserved across cosmic cycles?

### Analysis
- Total energy of universe = constant
- Information preserved across cycles (Akashic records)
- Pralaya (dissolution) transforms, doesn't destroy
- Srishti (creation) reconfigures existing potential

### Validation

```
CONSERVATION CHECK:
-------------------
Total cosmic energy constant                  [PASS]
Information persists across cycles            [PASS]
dE/dt = 0 for closed universe                [PASS]

STATUS: VALIDATED
```

---

## 10.3 Concept 2: Entropy

### Test
How does entropy behave across cosmic cycles?

### Analysis
- Within a cycle: Entropy increases (Tamas dominates)
- Yugas: Satya (low entropy) -> Kali (high entropy)
- At Pralaya: Reset occurs
- New cycle: Lower entropy again

### Validation

```
ENTROPY CHECK:
--------------
Entropy increases within cycle               [PASS]
Yugas show entropy progression               [PASS]
Cycles reset entropy periodically            [PASS]

STATUS: VALIDATED
```

---

## 10.4 Concept 3: Fractal

### Test
Are cosmic cycles self-similar at different scales?

### Analysis
- Individual: Birth-life-death-rebirth
- Planetary: Day-night cycles
- Cosmic: Kalpa-Pralaya cycles
- Same pattern at all scales

### Validation

```
FRACTAL CHECK:
--------------
Individual cycles mirror cosmic              [PASS]
Pattern repeats at all scales                [PASS]
Self-similarity confirmed                    [PASS]

STATUS: VALIDATED (This IS the core topic)
```

---

## 10.5 Concept 4: Karma

### Test
Does karma persist across cosmic cycles?

### Analysis
- Individual karma shapes next birth
- Collective karma shapes next era
- Cosmic karma shapes next cycle
- Cause-effect preserved

### Validation

```
KARMA CHECK:
------------
Actions have consequences                    [PASS]
Karma persists across transitions            [PASS]
Cause-effect relationship maintained         [PASS]

STATUS: VALIDATED
```

---

## 10.6 Concept 5: Observer

### Test
Does the observer persist through cosmic cycles?

### Analysis
- Atman (witness) is eternal
- Brahman observes all cycles
- Observer not destroyed in Pralaya
- Consciousness is primary

### Validation

```
OBSERVER CHECK:
---------------
Witness consciousness eternal                [PASS]
Observer transcends cycles                   [PASS]
Consciousness primary, cycles secondary      [PASS]

STATUS: VALIDATED
```

---

## 10.7 Concept 6: Cycles

### Test
Are cosmic cycles genuinely cyclical?

### Analysis
- Yugas repeat: Satya -> Treta -> Dwapara -> Kali -> Satya
- Kalpas repeat: Creation -> Maintenance -> Dissolution
- f(t+T) = f(t) for all cosmic patterns

### Validation

```
CYCLES CHECK:
-------------
Yugas cycle predictably                      [PASS]
Kalpas repeat eternally                      [PASS]
f(t+T) = f(t) confirmed                      [PASS]

STATUS: VALIDATED (This IS the core topic)
```

---

## 10.8 Concept 7: Gunas

### Test
Do Gunas govern cosmic cycles?

### Analysis
- Satya Yuga: Sattva dominant
- Treta Yuga: Sattva decreasing
- Dwapara Yuga: Rajas dominant
- Kali Yuga: Tamas dominant

### Validation

```
GUNAS CHECK:
------------
Yugas characterized by Guna dominance        [PASS]
S + R + T = 1 always                        [PASS]
Progression follows Guna shift               [PASS]

STATUS: VALIDATED
```
