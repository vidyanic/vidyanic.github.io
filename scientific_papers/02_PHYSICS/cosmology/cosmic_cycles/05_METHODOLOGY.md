## 5.3 Analytical Methods

### 5.3.1 Cycle Detection

```
FOURIER ANALYSIS:
=================
f(t) = Σ [aₙ cos(nωt) + bₙ sin(nωt)]

Applied to:
- Temperature time series
- Economic data
- Solar activity

Objective: Identify dominant frequencies
Expected: 11, 60-80, ~2000, ~26000 year periods
```

### 5.3.2 Pattern Matching

```
CORRELATION ANALYSIS:
=====================
r = Σ[(xᵢ - x̄)(yᵢ - ȳ)] / [√Σ(xᵢ - x̄)² × √Σ(yᵢ - ȳ)²]

Applied between:
- Scientific cycles and Yuga ratios
- Climate patterns and consciousness metrics
- Economic cycles and Vedic predictions
```

### 5.3.3 Fractal Validation

```
SELF-SIMILARITY CHECK:
======================
Pattern(n) ≈ Pattern(n±k) × ScaleFactor

Verify same Create-Maintain-Destroy at:
- Daily (24 hours)
- Annual (365 days)
- Precessional (26K years)
- Yuga (432K-1.7M years)
- Kalpa (4.32B years)
```

## 5.4 Validation Framework

### 5.4.1 7-Concept Stack Application

Each finding validated against:

| Concept | Test Method |
|---------|-------------|
| Conservation | Energy/info preserved across cycles? |
| Entropy | Progression within, reset between? |
| Fractal | Self-similar at all scales? |
| Karma | Cause-effect persists? |
| Observer | Consciousness continuous? |
| Cycles | Periodicity confirmed? |
| Gunas | S/R/T dynamics present? |

### 5.4.2 Cross-Validation

- Scientific data vs. Vedic predictions
- Multiple cycle sources for same period
- Inter-tradition corroboration

---

## 5.5 Limitations

### 5.5.1 Data Constraints

- Ice core data reliable only to ~800K years
- Written records ~5K years
- Statistical significance requires multiple cycles

### 5.5.2 Interpretation Challenges

- Vedic year lengths debated
- Starting point of current Yuga disputed
- Translation variations in texts

### 5.5.3 Mitigation

- Use multiple dating systems
- Cross-reference with astronomical events
- Focus on pattern rather than precise dates
