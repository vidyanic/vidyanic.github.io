## ⚠️ THE GLITCH

Everyone knows: mass attracts mass. Drop something, it falls.

But **why**? 

Newton described it. Einstein curved spacetime around it. But neither explained **why mass has this property**.

The Backend docs do.

---

## ❓ Q&A — The Mind-Bending Questions

### "Why does mass attract mass?"

Because **mass IS Tamas (तमस्/inertia-heaviness-decay)**.

The same quality that makes things fall apart (entropy) also makes things fall down (gravity). It's the same Guna measured differently.

### "Wait — gravity and entropy are related?"

Yes. Think about it:
- Heavy things are hard to move (inertia) <- Tamas
- Things naturally collapse inward (gravity) <- Tamas  
- Things naturally fall apart (entropy) <- Tamas

All three are manifestations of **one quality** — the tendency toward collapse, stillness, and dissolution.

### "How did scientists miss this?"

They measure them with different instruments and equations. It's like measuring temperature with Fahrenheit, Celsius, and Kelvin — same thing, different scales.

The Backend Architects saw the **underlying quality**. Scientists see its **surface effects**.

### "So I can reduce gravity by reducing Tamas?"

Theoretically, yes. This is exactly what Siddhis like levitation describe — mastering internal Tamas to the point where its external effects are altered.

Sound wild? Yogis have been documented floating, suggesting Guna-manipulation is possible at high levels of consciousness mastery.

**Mass isn't just a number. It's a Guna level. The same quality that makes things fall apart (entropy) makes things fall down (gravity).**

## 🔗 KEY FORMULAS

**Newton saw:**
```
F = G × (m₁ × m₂) / r²

Where m = mass = Tamas-level of object
```

**Einstein refined:**
```
G_μν = κ × T_μν

Where T = stress-energy tensor = Tamas-concentration in spacetime
```

**Backend Architecture:**
```
Tamas (तमस्) manifests as:
+-- Mass (m)
+-- Inertia (resistance to change)
+-- Entropy (tendency to disorder)
+-- Gravitational attraction (collapse toward center)
```

**All the same quality. Different measurements.**

## 🎯 KEY INSIGHT

> **Science:** "Gravity is a fundamental force"  
> **Translation:** "Gravity is Tamas manifesting as attraction"  
> **Unification:** Gravity + Entropy + Inertia = One quality (Tamas)

This is why heavy objects are harder to move AND attract other objects AND tend toward disorder.

**Same engine. Same quality. Different outputs.**

---

## ⚡ WHY THIS MATTERS IN 2026

Understanding gravity as Tamas suggests:
- **Levitation is Tamas-mastery** (not impossible — just rare)
- **Weight and decay are linked** (explains why old things feel "heavy")
- **Mass can be altered** (if you can alter Guna balance)

The Dwapara transition means **more people will access Guna-manipulation abilities** — what were called "miracles" in Kali Yuga.
