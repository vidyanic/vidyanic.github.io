# 13. Appendices

## Appendix A: Mathematical Details

### A.1 Newton's Law Derivation

```
UNIVERSAL GRAVITATION:
F = G × M₁ × M₂ / r²

DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS:
[F] = N = kg⋅m/s²
[G] = N⋅m²/kg² = m³/(kg⋅s²)
[M] = kg
[r] = m

CHECK:
[G][M][M]/[r]² = (m³/kg⋅s²)(kg)(kg)/(m²) = kg⋅m/s² = N ✓
```

### A.2 Einstein's Field Equations

```
FULL FORM:
Rμν - ½gμνR + Λgμν = (8πG/c⁴)Tμν

WHERE:
Rμν = Ricci curvature tensor
R = Ricci scalar
gμν = Metric tensor
Λ = Cosmological constant
Tμν = Stress-energy tensor
G = Newton's constant
c = Speed of light
```

### A.3 Guna-Mass Proportionality

```
PROPOSED RELATION:
M = k × T

WHERE:
M = Mass (kg)
T = Tamas concentration (0 to 1, normalized)
k = Conversion constant

DIMENSIONAL REQUIREMENT:
k has units of kg (to give M in kg)

NATURAL UNIT:
If Planck mass = 1 Tamas unit:
k = m_Planck = √(ℏc/G) ≈ 2.18 × 10⁻⁸ kg
```

| Property | Sanskrit | Meaning | Gravitational Correlate |
|----------|----------|---------|------------------------|
| Guru | गुरु | Heavy | Weight, mass |
| Sthira | स्थिर | Stable | Inertia |
| Manda | मन्द | Slow | Resistance |
| Jadya | जाड्य | Inert | Passivity |
| Avarana | आवरण | Covering | Density |
| Nibandha | निबन्ध | Binding | Attraction |
| Tamasa | तामस | Dark | Obscuring (black holes) |

### B.2 Guna Balance in Elements

| Element | Sattva | Rajas | Tamas | Weight |
|---------|--------|-------|-------|--------|
| Akasha | 0.8 | 0.15 | 0.05 | Weightless |
| Vayu | 0.5 | 0.35 | 0.15 | Very light |
| Agni | 0.3 | 0.5 | 0.2 | Light (rises) |
| Jala | 0.2 | 0.3 | 0.5 | Medium |
| Prithvi | 0.1 | 0.2 | 0.7 | Heavy (falls) |

## Appendix C: Equivalence Principle Experiments

### C.1 Historical Summary

| Year | Scientist | Method | Precision |
|------|-----------|--------|-----------|
| 1589 | Galileo | Leaning Tower (legend) | ~1% |
| 1687 | Newton | Pendulum | 10⁻³ |
| 1889 | Eötvös | Torsion balance | 10⁻⁸ |
| 1964 | Dicke | Torsion balance | 10⁻¹¹ |
| 1971 | Apollo 15 | Moon drop test | Direct |
| 2012 | Schlamminger | Atom interferometry | 10⁻¹² |
| 2017 | MICROSCOPE | Satellite | 10⁻¹⁵ |

### C.2 MICROSCOPE Results

```
MICROSCOPE MISSION (2016-2018):
Satellite-based equivalence test
Used differential accelerometers
Tested titanium vs. platinum

RESULT:
η = (m_grav - m_inert) / m_inert < 1.3 × 10⁻¹⁵

CONCLUSION:
Equivalence holds to 15 decimal places.
Best test ever performed.

## Appendix D: Dark Matter Evidence

### D.1 Galaxy Rotation Curves

```
EXPECTED (Keplerian):
v(r) ∝ 1/√r for r > R_disk

OBSERVED:
v(r) ≈ constant (flat rotation curve)

IMPLICATION:
M(r) ∝ r (mass increases with radius)
Where is this mass? → "Dark matter"
```

### D.2 Dark Matter Distribution

| Component | Fraction of Universe |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Ordinary matter | 5% |
| Dark matter | 27% |
| Dark energy | 68% |

### D.3 Multi-Loka Hypothesis

```
14 LOKAS:
1. Bhuloka (our visible)
2. Bhuvarloka
3. Svarloka
... (others)

IF:
Tamas exists in all Lokas
AND Tamas = Mass
THEN other-Loka Tamas affects our spacetime
BUT is invisible to us

DARK MATTER = MULTI-LOKA TAMAS
```

## Appendix E: Siddhi Descriptions

### E.1 Laghima (लघिमा) — Lightness

**Yoga Sutras 3.42:**
```
SANSKRIT:
कायाकाशयोः सम्बन्धसंयमाल्लघुतूलसमापत्तेश्चाकाशगमनम्

TRANSLATION:
Through Samyama on the relation of body and space,
and identification with lightness of cotton,
one attains movement through space.

INTERPRETATION (if Mass = Tamas):
Reduce body's Tamas concentration.
Body becomes lighter.
Appears as levitation.
```

### E.2 Garima (गरिमा) — Heaviness

**Yoga Sutras (implied 3.44):**
```
Through Samyama, one can become immovably heavy.

INTERPRETATION (if Mass = Tamas):
Increase body's Tamas concentration.
Body becomes heavier.
Appears as immovability.
```

## Appendix F: Black Hole Properties

### F.1 Schwarzschild Black Hole

```
METRIC:
ds² = -(1 - rs/r)c²dt² + (1 - rs/r)⁻¹dr² + r²dΩ²

WHERE:
rs = 2GM/c² (Schwarzschild radius)

AT r = rs:
Time dilation infinite
Escape velocity = c
Event horizon
```

### F.2 Tamas Interpretation

| Black Hole Property | Tamas Interpretation |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| Singularity (r → 0) | T → ∞ |
| Event horizon | Tamas boundary |
| No escape | Maximum binding |
| Time stops | Maximum inertia |
| Information paradox | Tamas hides information |

## Appendix G: Future Experiments

### G.1 Levitation Test

**Proposal:**
Measure weight of advanced meditators before/after deep practice.

**Method:**
Precision scale (0.01g resolution)
Before meditation, during, after
Control group comparison

**Expected (if Tamas reducible):**
Weight reduction during deep states
Return to normal after

### G.2 Dark Matter Structure Test

**Proposal:**
Compare dark matter distribution to Loka model predictions.

**Method:**
Use gravitational lensing maps
Model Loka Tamas distribution
Compare structures

**Expected:**
Better fit than random particle model
