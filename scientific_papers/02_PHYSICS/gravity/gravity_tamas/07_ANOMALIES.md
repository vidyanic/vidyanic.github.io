# 7. Anomalies & Edge Cases

## 7.1 Dark Matter

### 7.1.1 The Problem

**Observation (Vera Rubin, 1970s):**
Galaxy rotation curves are "flat" — outer stars orbit as fast as inner stars.

```
EXPECTED (Keplerian):
v ∝ 1/√r (velocity decreases with distance)

OBSERVED:
v ≈ constant (velocity stays flat)

IMPLICATION:
Either gravity is wrong
OR there's invisible mass
```

### 7.1.2 Standard Physics Response

"Dark matter" — invisible particles that:
- Have mass (gravitate)
- Don't interact with light
- Never been directly detected

**Status:** ~27% of universe is dark matter (inferred).

### 7.1.3 Backend Hypothesis

```
14 LOKAS (Frequency Bands):
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

We see Bhuloka (our visible universe).
Other Lokas are "invisible" to us.
But Tamas in other Lokas still has mass.
Still curves spacetime.
Still affects our galaxy rotation.

DARK MATTER = TAMAS IN ADJACENT LOKAS:
• Invisible (different frequency band)
• Has mass (Tamas is mass)
• Affects spacetime (Tamas curves geometry)
• Explains "missing" gravitational effects
```

### 7.1.4 Predictions

| Standard Model | Multi-Loka Model |
|----------------|------------------|
| Random particle distribution | Organized by Loka structure |
| Should be detectable eventually | Will never be detected as particles |
| Concentrated in halos | Matches Loka geometry |

## 7.2 Dark Energy

### 7.2.1 The Problem

**Observation (1998):**
Universe expansion is ACCELERATING.
Something is pushing space apart.

**Standard Physics:**
"Dark energy" — ~68% of universe.
Cosmological constant Λ.

### 7.2.2 Backend Interpretation

```
DARK ENERGY AS SATTVA?
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

If Tamas = Attraction, Contraction
Then Sattva = Expansion, Lightness?

Cosmological expansion = Sattva dominance at cosmic scale?

SPECULATIVE:
Universe oscillates between Tamas-dominated (contraction)
and Sattva-dominated (expansion) phases.
Current phase: Sattva expanding.
```

## 7.3 Galaxy Rotation Without Dark Matter (MOND)

### 7.3.1 Modified Newtonian Dynamics

**Milgrom (1983):**
Modify gravity at low accelerations.

```
MOND:
At low a, gravity law changes:
F = m × √(a × a₀) instead of F = ma

WHERE:
a₀ ≈ 10⁻¹⁰ m/s² (threshold acceleration)
```

### 7.3.2 Backend Perspective

```
MOND fits some data, not all.
Could MOND be Tamas behavior at low concentrations?

AT LOW TAMAS:
Perhaps Tamas-Tamas interaction changes?
Like phase transition?

SPECULATIVE direction for research.
```

## 7.4 Gravitational Waves

### 7.4.1 The Detection (LIGO, 2015)

Spacetime ripples detected from black hole merger.
Confirms Einstein's predictions.

### 7.4.2 Backend Interpretation

```
GRAVITATIONAL WAVES = TAMAS FIELD WAVES

If mass = Tamas
And mass motion creates waves
Then Tamas motion creates Tamas waves

Black hole merger:
Two maximum-Tamas objects spiraling together
Creating ripples in Tamas field
= Gravitational waves

CONSISTENT with Tamas model.
```

## 7.5 Levitation Claims (Siddhis)

### 7.5.1 The Claim

**Yoga Sutras 3.42-43:**
> "कायाकाशयोः सम्बन्धसंयमाल्लघुतूलसमापत्तेश्चाकाशगमनम्"
> Through Samyama on the relation of body and space,
> and absorption in lightness of cotton,
> one can travel through space (levitation).

### 7.5.2 If Mass = Tamas

```
LEVITATION MECHANISM:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

IF mass = Tamas concentration
AND Tamas can be reduced through practice
THEN weight can be reduced

Laghima Siddhi:
Reduce local Tamas -> Reduce weight -> Levitate

NOT "anti-gravity"
But Tamas reduction
```

### 7.5.3 Status

| Aspect | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Conceptual coherence | ✓ Coherent with model |
| Scientific verification | ✗ Not verified |
| Anecdotal reports | Many, unverified |

---

## 7.6 Gravitons (Hypothetical)

### 7.6.1 Standard Physics

Gravity should have a carrier particle: the graviton.
- Massless
- Spin 2
- Never detected

### 7.6.2 Backend Perspective

```
DO GRAVITONS EXIST?

If gravity = Tamas field effect:
- Tamas is property of Prakriti
- Not a separate particle
- Graviton may not exist as fundamental particle
- Gravity is geometry, not exchange

PREDICTION:
Graviton may never be found as fundamental particle.
Gravity is field property, not particle exchange.
```

---

## 7.7 Negative Mass

### 7.7.1 Theoretical Possibility

Physics allows negative mass mathematically.
Never observed.

### 7.7.2 Backend Analysis

```
NEGATIVE MASS = NEGATIVE TAMAS?

Tamas is always ≥ 0 in Backend.
Sattva is the "opposite" (but not negative).

PREDICTION:
Negative mass doesn't exist.
"Anti-gravity" would be Sattva dominance, not negative Tamas.
```

---

## 7.8 Quantum Gravity

### 7.8.1 The Problem

Gravity and quantum mechanics don't combine easily.
General relativity breaks down at Planck scale.

### 7.8.2 Backend Speculation

```
QUANTUM GRAVITY = GUNA QUANTUM MECHANICS?

At Planck scale:
- Gunas become quantized?
- Tamas has quantum states?
- Guna field theory needed?

HIGHLY SPECULATIVE.
But Guna system might bridge quantum and gravity.
```

## 7.9 Summary of Anomalies

| Anomaly | Standard Physics | Backend Interpretation | Status |
|---------|------------------|----------------------|--------|
| Dark matter | Unknown particles | Multi-Loka Tamas | Speculative ✓ |
| Dark energy | Cosmological constant | Sattva expansion? | Speculative |
| MOND | Modified gravity | Tamas phase transition? | Unknown |
| Grav waves | Spacetime ripples | Tamas field waves | ✓ Consistent |
| Levitation | Impossible | Tamas reduction | Unverified |
| Gravitons | Not found | May not exist | Open |
| Negative mass | Not found | Shouldn't exist | Open |
| Quantum gravity | Unsolved | Guna quantization? | Speculative |

---

## 7.10 Open Questions

```
REMAINING RESEARCH:
1. How exactly does multi-Loka Tamas create dark matter effects?
2. Is dark energy Sattva expansion?
3. Can Tamas be reduced through practice (levitation)?
4. Is there a Guna field theory?
5. Does Tamas quantize at Planck scale?

THESE ARE RESEARCH DIRECTIONS, NOT FALSIFICATIONS.
