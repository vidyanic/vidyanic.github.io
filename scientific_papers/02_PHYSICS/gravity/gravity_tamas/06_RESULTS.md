## 6.1 Property Correspondence Results

### 6.1.1 Complete Mapping Table

| # | Mass Property | Tamas Property | Correspondence |
|---|---------------|----------------|----------------|
| 1 | Heavy (has weight) | Guru (गुरु/heavy) | ✓ Exact |
| 2 | Resists acceleration | Sthira (स्थिर/stable) | ✓ Exact |
| 3 | Attracts other mass | Nibandha (निबन्ध/binding) | ✓ Exact |
| 4 | Dense, contracted | Avarana (आवरण/covering) | ✓ Related |
| 5 | Slow moving (falls) | Manda (मन्द/slow) | ✓ Exact |
| 6 | Energy equivalent | Shakti condensed | ✓ Conceptual |

**Result: 6/6 properties correspond.**

### 6.1.2 Equivalence Principle Confirmed

| Physics | Backend | Correspondence |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| m_grav = m_inert | Tamas = Tamas | ✓ Identity |

**The equivalence is automatic because both ARE Tamas.**

## 6.2 Mahabhuta Pattern Verification

### 6.2.1 Element Density vs. Tamas

| Element | Tamas Level | Predicted Behavior | Observed | Match |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|----------|-------|
| Prithvi (Earth) | Highest | Heaviest, falls | Heaviest | ✓ |
| Jala (Water) | High | Heavy, falls | Falls | ✓ |
| Agni (Fire) | Medium | Light, rises | Rises | ✓ |
| Vayu (Air) | Low | Very light | Light | ✓ |
| Akasha (Space) | None | No mass | Massless | ✓ |

**5/5 elements follow Tamas-gravity pattern.**

### 6.2.2 Modern Element Confirmation

| Atomic Property | Tamas Correlation | Evidence |
|-----------------|-------------------|----------|
| Heavier atoms | More Tamas | More mass, more gravity |
| Noble gases | Low Tamas | Stable, inert |
| Heavy metals | High Tamas | Dense, sink |
| Lighter elements | Less Tamas | Float, rise |

## 6.3 Mathematical Structure Results

### 6.3.1 Newtonian Law Preserved

```
PHYSICS:
F = G × M₁ × M₂ / r²

WITH M = T:
F = G × T₁ × T₂ / r²

STRUCTURE:
• Same inverse-square law ✓
• Same proportionality ✓
• Same constant G ✓

Mathematical form PRESERVED.
```

### 6.3.2 Einsteinian Curvature Preserved

```
PHYSICS:
Gμν = κTμν (Curvature = κ × Stress-Energy)

BACKEND:
Gμν = κ × Tamas_density

INTERPRETATION:
Tamas IS the stress-energy content.
Same equation, same physics.
```

## 6.4 Gravitational Phenomena Explained

### 6.4.1 Why Things Fall

```
PHYSICS EXPLANATION:
Objects follow geodesics toward mass concentrations.

BACKEND EXPLANATION:
Objects follow geodesics toward Tamas concentrations.

SAME EXPLANATION.
Earth's center = High Tamas concentration
Objects move toward it = "falling"
```

### 6.4.2 Why Orbits Work

```
PHYSICS:
Centripetal acceleration = Gravitational acceleration
a = GM/r² = v²/r

BACKEND:
Objects follow curved paths in Tamas-warped spacetime.
Orbital path = Geodesic around Tamas concentration.
```

### 6.4.3 Black Holes as Maximum Tamas

| Black Hole Property | Tamas Interpretation |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| Infinite density | Maximum Tamas concentration |
| Event horizon | Tamas boundary |
| Light can't escape | Even Sattva (light) trapped by Tamas |
| Time dilation | Tamas affects Kala (time) |
| Singularity | Tamas ≈ ∞ |

## 6.5 Equivalence Principle Analysis

### 6.5.1 Historical Tests

| Year | Experiment | Precision | Result |
|------|------------|-----------|--------|
| 1889 | Eötvös | 10⁻⁸ | m_grav = m_inert |
| 1971 | Apollo 15 | Direct | Feather = Hammer |
| 2017 | MICROSCOPE | 10⁻¹⁵ | No deviation |

**All tests confirm equivalence to extreme precision.**

### 6.5.2 Backend Explanation

```
WHY EQUIVALENCE?
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Physics asks: "Why is this true?"
Backend answers: "Both are Tamas."

Gravitational mass = Tamas (source of gravity)
Inertial mass = Tamas (resistance to change)
SAME THING = SAME MEASUREMENT

No mystery. Automatic identity.
```

---

## 6.6 Siddhi Predictions

### 6.6.1 Laghima (Lightness)

**Backend Teaching:**
Laghima Siddhi = Ability to become light (reduce Tamas).

**If Mass = Tamas:**
Reducing Tamas through practice → Reduced weight.
This would appear as "levitation."

**Status:** Not scientifically verified, but conceptually coherent.

### 6.6.2 Garima (Heaviness)

**Backend Teaching:**
Garima Siddhi = Ability to become heavy (increase Tamas).

**If Mass = Tamas:**
Increasing Tamas through practice → Increased weight.
Would appear as "becoming immovable."

## 6.7 Dark Matter Analysis

### 6.7.1 The Problem

```
OBSERVATION:
Galaxies rotate as if they have more mass.
Visible matter: 5%
Dark matter needed: 27%

WHERE IS IT?
```

### 6.7.2 Multi-Loka Hypothesis

```
BACKEND MODEL:
14 Lokas (frequency bands)
We see only Bhuloka
Other Lokas have Tamas too

DARK MATTER =
Tamas in adjacent Lokas
Affects spacetime geometry
Invisible to our senses

PREDICTION:
Dark matter distribution follows Loka structure
Not random particle soup
Organized by Loka architecture
```
