# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 The Gravity Mystery

Newton told us HOW gravity works:

```
F = G × (M₁ × M₂) / r²

WHERE:
F = Gravitational force
G = Gravitational constant (6.67×10⁻¹¹ N⋅m²/kg²)
M = Masses
r = Distance between centers
```

But Newton himself admitted he didn't know WHY:

> "I have not been able to discover the cause of these properties of gravity from phenomena... Hypotheses non fingo."
> — Isaac Newton, Principia (1687)

## 1.2 Einstein's Geometry

Einstein reframed gravity not as force but as geometry:

```
Gμν = κTμν

WHERE:
Gμν = Einstein tensor (spacetime curvature)
κ = 8πG/c⁴
Tμν = Stress-energy tensor (matter-energy)

MEANING:
"Matter tells spacetime how to curve.
 Spacetime tells matter how to move."
```

This explains HOW gravity works geometrically. But still not WHY:
- Why does matter curve spacetime?
- What IS mass?
- Why do things have inertia?

## 1.4 Paper Objectives

This paper will:

1. **Map mass to Tamas** from the Backend Framework
2. **Explain gravity as Tamas effect** on spacetime
3. **Show Newtonian and Einsteinian** physics as Tamas descriptions
4. **Address dark matter** as multi-Loka Tamas
5. **Validate** through formula correspondence

## 1.5 The Backend Perspective

The Guna system describes three fundamental qualities:

```
GUNA SYSTEM:
━━━━━━━━━━━━
SATTVA (सत्त्व) = Light, buoyancy, order
RAJAS (रजस्)  = Activity, motion, energy  
TAMAS (तमस्)  = Heavy, inert, dark

TAMAS SPECIFICALLY:
• Guru (गुरु) = Heavy, weighty
• Sthira (स्थिर) = Stable, unmoving
• Manda (मन्द) = Slow, sluggish
• Nishkriya (निष्क्रिय) = Inactive
```

**Key observation:** These are EXACTLY the properties of mass.

## 1.6 The Proposed Mapping

```
MASS = TAMAS CONCENTRATION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

MASS PROPERTIES          TAMAS PROPERTIES
Heavy                    Guru (गुरु/heavy)
Inert                    Sthira (स्थिर/stable)
Resists acceleration     Tamas resists change
Gravitates               Tamas attracts Tamas

GRAVITATIONAL FORCE = TAMAS FIELD EFFECT
Objects don't "attract"
They follow geodesics toward Tamas concentrations
```

## 1.7 Why This Matters

If gravity = Tamas:
- Mass is Guna composition
- Physics is Guna dynamics
- Anti-gravity = Sattva dominance
- Levitation Siddhis are coherent
