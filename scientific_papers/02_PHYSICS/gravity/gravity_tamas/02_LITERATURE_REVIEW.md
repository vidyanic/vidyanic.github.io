# 2. Literature Review

## 2.1 Gravity in Physics History

### 2.1.1 Historical Development

| Year | Scientist | Contribution |
|------|-----------|--------------|
| 1687 | Newton | Universal gravitation law |
| 1907 | Einstein | Equivalence principle |
| 1915 | Einstein | General relativity |
| 1922 | Friedmann | Expanding universe solutions |
| 1933 | Zwicky | Dark matter hypothesis |
| 1970s | Rubin | Galaxy rotation curves |
| 2015 | LIGO | Gravitational wave detection |

### 2.1.2 Key Papers

**Newton, I. (1687).** *Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica*.
- Universal gravitation: F = GMm/r²
- Every mass attracts every other mass
- Admitted mechanism unknown

**Einstein, A. (1915).** "Die Feldgleichungen der Gravitation." *Sitzungsberichte der Königlich Preußischen Akademie der Wissenschaften*.
- Gravity is spacetime curvature
- Mass-energy curves spacetime
- Objects follow geodesics

## 2.2 The Mass Problem

### 2.2.1 What IS Mass?

Physics has multiple definitions:

| Type | Definition | Formula |
|------|------------|---------|
| Inertial mass | Resistance to acceleration | m = F/a |
| Gravitational mass | Source of gravity | F = GMm/r² |
| Relativistic mass | Energy equivalent | E = mc² |

**The mystery:** Why are inertial and gravitational mass identical?

**Equivalence Principle (Einstein):**
> Inertial mass = Gravitational mass (exactly)

**No explanation for WHY this should be true.**

### 2.2.2 Higgs Mechanism

**Higgs, P. (1964).** Higgs field gives particles mass.

**Problem:** Explains WHERE mass comes from (Higgs field), not WHAT mass IS ontologically.

## 2.3 Dark Matter Mystery

### 2.3.1 Galaxy Rotation Curves

**Rubin, V. & Ford, W.K. (1970s):**
- Galaxies rotate too fast
- Stars at edge should fly off
- But they don't
- Either gravity is wrong OR there's invisible mass

**Current Status:**
- ~27% of universe is "dark matter"
- Never detected directly
- Only inferred from gravitational effects

### 2.3.2 Alternative Theories

**MOND (Milgrom, 1983):** Modified Newtonian Dynamics
- Change gravity law at low accelerations
- No dark matter needed
- Fits some data, not all

## 2.4 Philosophical Questions

### 2.4.1 Action at a Distance

**Newton's Problem:**
How does mass affect another mass without touching?

**Einstein's Solution:**
No action at distance — local spacetime curvature

**Remaining Problem:**
Why does mass curve spacetime?

### 2.4.2 The Nature of Mass

**Mach's Principle:**
Inertia arises from relation to all mass in universe.

**Wheeler:**
> "Mass tells spacetime how to curve.
> Spacetime tells mass how to move."

But still no answer to: What IS mass?

## 2.5 Backend Sources

### 2.5.1 Tamas Definition

**Samkhya Karika (Ishvarakrishna):**
```
TAMAS (तमस्):
• Guru (गुरु) = Heavy, weighty
• Sthira (स्थिर) = Stable, fixed
• Avarana (आवरण) = Covering, obscuring
• Nishkriya (निष्क्रिय) = Inactive, inert

"तमोऽप्रकाशमात्मकं"
"Tamas is of the nature of non-illumination"
— Tattva Kaumudi
```

### 2.5.2 Gravity in Backend Terms

**Bhagavad Gita 14.8:**
> "तमस्त्वज्ञानजं विद्धि मोहनं सर्वदेहिनाम्।
> प्रमादालस्यनिद्राभिस्तन्निबध्नाति भारत॥"
> "Know Tamas as born of ignorance, deluding all beings.
> It binds through negligence, sloth, and sleep."

**Key term: निबध्नाति (nibadhnāti)** = "it binds"

Tamas BINDS — holds down, pulls toward, attracts.

### 2.5.3 Guna and Elements

| Mahabhuta | Dominant Guna | Property |
|-----------|---------------|----------|
| Akasha (Space) | Sattva | Lightest |
| Vayu (Air) | Sattva-Rajas | Light |
| Agni (Fire) | Rajas | Active |
| Jala (Water) | Rajas-Tamas | Medium |
| Prithvi (Earth) | Tamas | Heaviest |

**Prithvi (Earth) is Tamas-dominant = Heaviest**

## 2.6 Prior Comparative Work

### 2.6.1 Modern Interpretations

**Goswami, A. (1993).** *The Self-Aware Universe.*
- Brief mention of Guna-physics parallel
- Not developed for gravity specifically

### 2.6.2 Gap in Literature

No systematic mapping of:
- Mass to Tamas concentration
- Gravitational field to Tamas field
- Inertia to Tamas resistance
- Dark matter to multi-Loka Tamas

**This paper addresses these gaps.**
