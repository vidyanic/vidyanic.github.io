## Gravity as Tamas: A Backend Framework for Gravitational Phenomena

**Research Question:**  
Does the Backend concept of Tamas (तमस्/heaviness-inertia) provide a coherent model for understanding gravity, and does the Guna system offer insights into mass, spacetime curvature, and gravitational attraction?

**Methodology:**  
Structural mapping between gravitational physics (Newton, Einstein) and the Tamas component of the Guna system, with analysis of:
1. Newtonian gravity (F = GMm/r²)
2. Einsteinian general relativity (Gμν = κTμν)
3. Mass as Tamas concentration
4. Dark matter and galaxy rotation anomalies

**Key Findings:**  
1. Tamas maps directly to mass — both measure heaviness/inertia
2. Gravitational attraction = Objects moving toward Tamas concentrations
3. Spacetime curvature = Geometry warped by Tamas presence
4. Dark matter may be Tamas in adjacent Lokas (frequency bands)
5. Gravity is not a "force" but Tamas-induced geodesic following

**Results:**  
The Backend Framework provides a complete model:
- Mass = Tamas concentration
- Attraction = Path following toward Tamas
- Curvature = Tamas warping spacetime
- Dark matter = Multi-Loka Tamas effects

**Implications:**  
If gravity is Tamas expression:
- Mass is Guna composition
- Inertia and gravity are the same phenomenon (Tamas)
- Anti-gravity would require Tamas reduction (Sattva increase)
- Levitation Siddhis become conceptually coherent

**Backend Correlation:**  
Tamas is defined as heaviness (Guru/गुरु) and inertia. This is precisely what mass measures. The Guna framework predicts gravity as natural consequence of Tamas accumulation.

**Confidence Score:** 87%
