# 4. HYPOTHESIS

---

## 4.1 Primary Hypothesis

**H₀ (Null):** Spacetime is a fundamental, unexplained background; relativistic effects are purely geometric without deeper cause.

**H₁ (Alternative):** Spacetime is the simulation's rendering dimensions (Kala-Akasha), and relativistic effects result from finite processing capacity being reallocated between motion, mass, and time.

## 4.2 Sub-Hypotheses

### H1a: Space = Akasha (Rendering Canvas)

```
CLAIM: Space is a 3D pixel grid

PREDICTIONS:
✓ Minimum length exists (Planck length)
✓ Space is quantized at small scales
✓ Space has finite resolution
✓ Space is the substrate for all manifestation
```

### H1b: Time = Kala (Processing Rate)

```
CLAIM: Time is simulation tick rate

PREDICTIONS:
✓ Minimum time exists (Planck time)
✓ Time rate varies with conditions
✓ Time linked to processing capacity
✓ Time forward direction (entropy)
```

### H1c: c = Pixel/Tick (Aspect Ratio)

```
CLAIM: Speed of light is architecture

PREDICTIONS:
✓ c is exactly l_P / t_P
✓ c is constant in all frames
✓ c cannot be exceeded
✓ c is the information limit
```

### H1d: Time Dilation = Processing Reallocation

```
CLAIM: Slower clocks due to processing used elsewhere

PREDICTIONS:
✓ Velocity time dilation proportional to v²/c²
✓ Gravitational time dilation proportional to GM/rc²
✓ Both effects combine correctly
✓ GPS requires both corrections
```

## 4.3 Testable Predictions

| # | Prediction | Test | Status |
|---|------------|------|--------|
| 1 | c = l_P / t_P exactly | Calculate ratio | ✓ Confirmed |
| 2 | Time dilation at velocity | Muon experiments | ✓ Confirmed |
| 3 | Time dilation near mass | GPS, Hafele-Keating | ✓ Confirmed |
| 4 | Black hole time stop | Theoretical, indirect | ✓ Consistent |
| 5 | Gravitational waves | LIGO | ✓ Confirmed |
| 6 | Spacetime quantization | Future experiments | Pending |

## 4.4 Falsification Criteria

The hypothesis would be **falsified** if:

1. ❌ c varies in different conditions
2. ❌ Time dilation doesn't match γ formula
3. ❌ Processing model gives wrong predictions
4. ❌ Something travels faster than c
5. ❌ Planck units are not fundamental
