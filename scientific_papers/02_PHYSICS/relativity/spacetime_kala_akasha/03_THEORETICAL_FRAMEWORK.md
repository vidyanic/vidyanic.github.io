# 3. THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK

---

## 3.1 The Kala-Akasha Model

### 3.1.1 Akasha = Rendering Canvas

```
AKASHA (आकाश) = SPACE:
=======================

• The 3D grid on which reality is rendered
• Measured in PIXELS (minimum = Planck length)
• Not empty — it's the substrate of manifestation
• "Contains" all that exists

PROPERTIES:
• Isotropic (same in all directions)
• Homogeneous (same everywhere)
• Infinite or bounded (depends on Brahmanda topology)
• First of the 5 elements
```

### 3.1.2 Kala = Processing Rate

```
KALA (काल) = TIME:
===================

• The simulation clock tick rate
• Measured in TICKS (minimum = Planck time)
• Not flowing — it's the sequence of computational frames
• "Orders" all events

PROPERTIES:
• Forward direction (entropy increase)
• Rate varies (time dilation)
• Linked to processing capacity
• Related to consciousness (different in different Lokas)
```

### 3.1.3 c = Aspect Ratio

```
c = PIXEL / TICK:
=================

c = l_P / t_P = 1.616×10⁻³⁵ m / 5.39×10⁻⁴⁴ s = 299,792,458 m/s

MEANING:
• Maximum rate of information propagation
• The "conversion factor" between space and time
• ARCHITECTURE, not physics
• Cannot be exceeded (rendering limit)
```

## 3.2 Time Dilation as Processing Reallocation

### 3.2.1 Velocity Time Dilation

```
STANDARD FORMULA:
=================
t' = t × γ = t / √(1 - v²/c²)

BACKEND INTERPRETATION:
=======================
Total processing = 100%

At rest (v=0):
• Motion processing = 0%
• Time processing = 100%
• Time runs at normal rate

At velocity v:
• Motion processing = (v/c)² × 100%
• Time processing = (1 - v²/c²) × 100%
• Time runs slower

At v = c (impossible for massive objects):
• Motion processing = 100%
• Time processing = 0%
• Time stops (photon perspective)
```

### 3.2.2 Gravitational Time Dilation

```
STANDARD FORMULA:
=================
t' = t × √(1 - 2GM/rc²)

BACKEND INTERPRETATION:
=======================
Mass = Tamas content
More Tamas = More processing overhead

Near massive object (high Tamas):
• Tamas processing = high
• Time processing = reduced
• Clock runs slow

Far from mass (low Tamas):
• Tamas processing = low
• Time processing = normal
• Clock runs normal

At event horizon (r = 2GM/c²):
• Tamas processing = 100%
• Time processing = 0%
• Time stops
```

## 3.3 E = mc² as Tamas-Locked Energy

### 3.3.1 Mass-Energy Equivalence

```
E = mc²

BACKEND INTERPRETATION:
=======================
E = Total energy
m = Tamas content
c² = (Aspect ratio)²

MEANING:
• Mass is energy "locked" by Tamas
• The c² factor is the conversion rate
• Unlocking mass releases energy (nuclear)
• Tamas -> Rajas conversion
```

### 3.3.2 Rest Mass vs Kinetic Energy

```
TOTAL ENERGY:
=============
E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²

WHERE:
• (mc²)² = Rest mass energy (Tamas-locked)
• (pc)² = Kinetic energy (Rajas)
• E = Total energy

FOR PHOTON (m=0):
E = pc (pure Rajas, no Tamas)

FOR MASSIVE PARTICLE:
E = γmc² (Tamas + Rajas)
```

## 3.4 Spacetime Curvature as Processing Gradient

### 3.4.1 Curvature Interpretation

```
STANDARD VIEW:
==============
Mass curves spacetime geometry

BACKEND VIEW:
=============
Mass (Tamas) creates processing gradient:
• Near mass: High processing demand
• Far from mass: Low processing demand
• Gradient = "curvature"

Objects follow paths of least processing (geodesics)
This APPEARS as curved motion
```

### 3.4.2 Geodesics

```
GEODESIC = Minimum processing path

In flat space: Straight line
Near mass: Curved path (efficient given processing gradient)

Planets orbit Sun not because of "force"
But because orbit is the minimum processing path
```
