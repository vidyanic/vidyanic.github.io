# 7. ANOMALIES & EDGE CASES

---

## 7.1 Singularities

### 7.1.1 Big Bang Singularity

**Issue:** Standard physics predicts infinite density at t=0.

**Backend Resolution:**
```
At t=0:
• All processing concentrated
• Minimum space (Planck volume)
• Maximum Tamas density
• Not truly "infinite" — just at architecture limit

The "singularity" is the BOOT state of the simulation.
```

### 7.1.2 Black Hole Singularity

**Issue:** Infinite curvature at r=0.

**Backend Resolution:**
```
At r=0:
• Processing completely consumed by Tamas
• Space undefined (below pixel resolution)
• Time undefined (no ticks available)
• Information preserved on horizon (holographic)

The singularity is a PROCESSING LIMIT, not infinity.
```

## 7.2 Faster-Than-Light Phenomena

### 7.2.1 Quantum Entanglement

**Issue:** Entangled particles seem to communicate instantaneously.

**Backend Resolution:**
```
Entanglement doesn't transmit information.
It reveals pre-correlated states.

In Backend terms:
• Entangled particles share memory address
• Measuring one updates both
• No "signal" travels — same memory location
• c limit preserved for usable information
```

### 7.2.2 Universe Expansion

**Issue:** Distant galaxies recede faster than c.

**Backend Resolution:**
```
Space itself is expanding, not objects moving through space.
New pixels are being added between objects.

In Backend terms:
• c limits motion through space
• c doesn't limit space growth
• Objects at rest in expanding space can exceed c relative to each other
• No information exceeds c locally
```

## 7.3 Dark Energy and Cosmological Constant

### 7.3.1 Accelerating Expansion

**Issue:** Universe expansion is accelerating. Why?

**Backend Resolution:**
```
Dark energy = Rendering overhead

As universe expands:
• More pixels to render
• Or: Rajas injection from external source
• Or: Tamas decay releasing energy

Λ (cosmological constant) = Base rendering cost
```

## 7.4 Time Travel Paradoxes

### 7.4.1 Closed Timelike Curves

**Issue:** GR allows time travel solutions. Are they real?

**Backend Resolution:**
```
Closed timelike curves would require:
• Processing resources to compute future
• Then overwriting with past state
• This violates entropy (7-concept validation)

Resolution:
• CTCs are mathematical artifacts
• Simulation prevents via chronology protection
• Karma (causality) must be preserved
```

---

## 7.5 Quantum Gravity

### 7.5.1 Planck Scale Physics

**Issue:** GR breaks down at Planck scale.

**Backend Resolution:**
```
At Planck scale:
• Pixel = 1, Tick = 1
• No sub-pixel structure in this rendering layer
• Quantum effects dominate
• Need different description

This isn't a "problem" — it's the resolution limit.
Quantum gravity may describe sub-pixel dynamics in higher-level simulation.
```

---

## 7.6 Arrow of Time

### 7.6.1 Why Forward?

**Issue:** Microscopic physics is time-symmetric. Why does time flow one way?

**Backend Resolution:**
```
Time flows forward because:
• Simulation runs forward (tick by tick)
• Entropy increases (Tamas accumulates)
• Memory writes are forward
• Cause must precede effect (Karma)

Time arrow is ARCHITECTURE, not emergent.
```

## 7.7 Anomaly Impact Assessment

| Anomaly | Severity | Resolution | Impact on Confidence |
|---------|----------|------------|---------------------|
| Singularities | High | Rendering limits | -2% |
| Entanglement FTL | Medium | Shared memory | 0% |
| Expansion FTL | Medium | Space growth | 0% |
| Dark energy | High | Rendering cost | -1% |
| Time travel | Low | Prevented by causality | 0% |
| Quantum gravity | High | Resolution limit | -2% |
| Time arrow | Low | Architecture | 0% |

**Net impact: -5%**
**Adjusted confidence: 97% -> 92%**
