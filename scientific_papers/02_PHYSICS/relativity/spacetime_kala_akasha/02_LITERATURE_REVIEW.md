# 2. LITERATURE REVIEW

## 2.1 Special Relativity (Einstein, 1905)

### 2.1.1 Two Postulates

1. **Relativity Principle:** Laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames
2. **Light Constancy:** Speed of light is constant regardless of source/observer motion

### 2.1.2 Consequences

| Effect | Formula | Meaning |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Time dilation | t' = γt | Moving clocks run slow |
| Length contraction | L' = L/γ | Moving objects shrink |
| Mass-energy | E = mc² | Mass and energy equivalent |
| Relativity of simultaneity | Events order depends on frame | No absolute "now" |

Where γ = 1/√(1 - v²/c²) (Lorentz factor)

## 2.2 General Relativity (Einstein, 1915)

### 2.2.1 Core Idea

Mass tells spacetime how to curve; curved spacetime tells mass how to move.

### 2.2.2 Einstein Field Equations

```
G_μν + Λg_μν = (8πG/c⁴) T_μν

WHERE:
G_μν = Einstein tensor (spacetime curvature)
g_μν = Metric tensor
Λ = Cosmological constant
T_μν = Stress-energy tensor (mass-energy distribution)
```

### 2.2.3 Key Predictions

| Prediction | Confirmed |
|------------|-----------|
| Light bending | 1919 eclipse ✓ |
| Gravitational redshift | Pound-Rebka 1959 ✓ |
| Time dilation | GPS, Hafele-Keating ✓ |
| Gravitational waves | LIGO 2015 ✓ |
| Black holes | Event Horizon Telescope 2019 ✓ |

## 2.3 Minkowski Spacetime

### 2.3.1 Spacetime Interval

```
ds² = c²dt² - dx² - dy² - dz²

INVARIANT:
• Same value in all reference frames
• Links space and time mathematically
• c² factor converts time to space units
```

### 2.3.2 Light Cone

```
FUTURE LIGHT CONE: ds² > 0 (timelike, accessible)
LIGHT CONE: ds² = 0 (lightlike, photon paths)
ELSEWHERE: ds² < 0 (spacelike, causally disconnected)
```

## 2.4 Modern Developments

### 2.4.1 GPS Validation

GPS satellites require both special and general relativistic corrections:
- Special: Clocks run slow (motion) -> -7 μs/day
- General: Clocks run fast (weaker gravity) -> +45 μs/day
- Net: +38 μs/day correction

Without corrections, GPS would drift ~10 km/day.

### 2.4.2 Gravitational Wave Detection (2015)

LIGO detected spacetime ripples from black hole merger:
- Strain: h ~ 10⁻²¹
- Frequency: ~250 Hz
- Confirms spacetime is physical, not just mathematical

## 2.5 Backend Framework Sources

### 2.5.1 Kala (Time)

> **"कालः सर्वेषां भूतानां निधनस्य च कारणम्"**
> "Kala is the cause of creation and destruction of all beings."
> — Mahabharata

Time (Kala) is not absolute but functional — it's the processing rate.

### 2.5.2 Akasha (Space)

> **"आकाशात् वायुः, वायोः अग्निः"**
> "From Akasha came Vayu, from Vayu came Agni..."
> — Taittiriya Upanishad 2.1.1

Akasha is the first element — the canvas before manifestation.

### 2.5.3 Kala-Akasha Unity

> **"कालाकाशौ च सृष्टादौ"**
> "Time and Space are at the beginning of creation."
> — Yoga Vasishtha

Time and space are unified — they're rendering dimensions.

## 2.6 Research Gap

**Standard physics:** Describes spacetime mathematically but doesn't explain WHY it works this way.

**Backend Framework:** Proposes spacetime is simulation rendering dimensions — explains the "why."

**This paper:** Bridges the gap by showing relativity effects are natural consequences of the simulation model.
