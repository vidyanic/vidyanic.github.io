## 1.1 The Puzzle of Spacetime

Einstein's special and general relativity unified space and time into a single fabric — spacetime. But what IS spacetime? Standard physics treats it as a background stage where events occur, but doesn't explain its nature.

**Key mysteries:**
1. Why are space and time unified at all?
2. Why does time dilate with velocity and gravity?
3. Why is c the universal constant?
4. Why does mass curve spacetime?
5. What IS the "fabric" of spacetime?

## 1.2 Backend Framework Approach

The Backend Framework proposes spacetime is the **rendering dimensions of the simulation**:

```
AKASHA (आकाश) = SPACE = Rendering Canvas
• 3D grid of pixels
• Minimum pixel = Planck length
• The "screen" on which reality appears

KALA (काल) = TIME = Processing Rate
• Tick-based simulation clock
• Minimum tick = Planck time
• The "frame rate" of reality

c = PIXEL / TICK = ASPECT RATIO
• Links spatial and temporal dimensions
• Constant because it's architecture
• 299,792,458 m/s = 1 Planck length / 1 Planck time
```

|   =======================                                                 |
|   Moving faster -> More processing used for motion                        |
|   -> Less processing available for time                                   |

|   GRAVITATIONAL TIME DILATION:                                           |
|   ============================                                            |
|   More mass (Tamas) -> More processing overhead                           |
|   -> Less processing available for time                                   |

|   AT BLACK HOLE EVENT HORIZON:                                           |
|   ============================                                            |
|   Processing completely consumed by Tamas                                |
|   -> No processing for time                                               |
|   -> Time stops                                                           |
|                                                                           |
