## 🎯 KEY QUESTION

**Why are space and time unified? Why does time dilate with velocity and gravity?**

---

## 📋 QUICK ANSWERS

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| What is spacetime? | Kala-Akasha (काल-आकाश) — Time woven into Space |
| Why do they unify? | Both are rendering dimensions of the simulation |
| Why time dilation? | Processing cost varies with Guna state |
| Why at c²? | c = 1 pixel/tick, c² = conversion factor |
| Why mass curves space? | Tamas (mass) creates processing overhead |

## 📊 TIME DILATION EXPLAINED

### Velocity Time Dilation

```
γ = 1/√(1 - v²/c²)

BACKEND INTERPRETATION:
=======================

At rest: Processing at normal tick rate
Moving at v: Some processing capacity used for motion

FORMULA:
t' = t × γ = t / √(1 - v²/c²)

As v -> c:
• More Rajas (motion) = Less processing for time
• Clock slows relative to stationary observer
• At v = c: Time stops (all processing for motion)
```

### Gravitational Time Dilation

```
t' = t × √(1 - 2GM/rc²)

BACKEND INTERPRETATION:
=======================

More mass (Tamas) = More processing overhead
-> Less processing capacity for time
-> Time runs slower

Near black hole:
• Tamas dominant
• Processing overwhelmed
• Time nearly stops at event horizon
```

---

## 🔬 CORE EQUATIONS

### Minkowski Metric

```
ds² = c²dt² - dx² - dy² - dz²

BACKEND:
ds² = (ticks)² - (pixels_x)² - (pixels_y)² - (pixels_z)²

The c² factor converts ticks to pixels (same units).
```

### Einstein Field Equations

```
G_μν = (8πG/c⁴) × T_μν

BACKEND:
Spacetime_curvature = Tamas_content × Architecture_factor

Mass (Tamas) curves spacetime (affects rendering).
```
