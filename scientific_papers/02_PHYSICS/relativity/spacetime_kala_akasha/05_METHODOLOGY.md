## 5.3 Mathematical Verification

### 5.3.1 c Calculation

```
STEP 1: Get Planck units
l_P = √(ℏG/c³) = 1.616255 × 10⁻³⁵ m
t_P = √(ℏG/c⁵) = 5.391247 × 10⁻⁴⁴ s

STEP 2: Calculate ratio
c = l_P / t_P = 1.616255 × 10⁻³⁵ / 5.391247 × 10⁻⁴⁴
c = 2.99792458 × 10⁸ m/s

STEP 3: Compare to measured c
c_measured = 299,792,458 m/s (exact by definition)

RESULT: EXACT MATCH ✓
```

### 5.3.2 Time Dilation Formula Derivation

```
VELOCITY TIME DILATION:
=======================
Total processing = P_total = 1 (normalized)

At velocity v:
Motion processing = P_motion = (v/c)²
Time processing = P_time = 1 - (v/c)² = 1 - v²/c²

Time rate = √(P_time) = √(1 - v²/c²) = 1/γ

Therefore: t' = t × γ ✓ (matches Einstein)


GRAVITATIONAL TIME DILATION:
============================
Total processing = P_total = 1 (normalized)

Near mass M at distance r:
Tamas processing = P_tamas = 2GM/rc²
Time processing = P_time = 1 - 2GM/rc²

Time rate = √(P_time) = √(1 - 2GM/rc²)

Therefore: t' = t × √(1 - 2GM/rc²) ✓ (matches Schwarzschild)
