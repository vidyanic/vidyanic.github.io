## 6.1 Property Correspondence Results

### 6.1.1 Complete Mapping Table

| # | Entropy Property | Tamas Property | Correspondence |
|---|------------------|----------------|----------------|
| 1 | Measures disorder | Is disorder/dissolution | ✓ Exact |
| 2 | Increases in isolation | Dominates naturally | ✓ Exact |
| 3 | Maximum at equilibrium | Maximum at Pralaya | ✓ Exact |
| 4 | Cannot be destroyed | Only transformed | ✓ Exact |
| 5 | Defines time arrow | Creates temporal flow | ✓ Exact |
| 6 | Statistical (probabilistic) | Probabilistic tendency | ✓ Exact |
| 7 | Related to information loss | Is ignorance/obscuration | ✓ Exact |

**Result: 7/7 properties correspond exactly.**

### 6.1.2 Conservation Law Correspondence

| Physics | Backend | Correspondence |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| E = E_kin + E_pot + E_thermal | Total = S + R + T | ✓ |
| dE/dt = 0 (isolated) | d(S+R+T)/dt = 0 | ✓ |
| Energy transforms | Gunas transform | ✓ |

**Result: Conservation laws match structurally.**

## 6.2 Second Law Verification

### 6.2.1 Entropy Increase in Thermodynamic Processes

| Process | ΔS | ΔT (Tamas) | Match |
|---------|-----|------------|-------|
| Heat flow (hot->cold) | + | + | ✓ |
| Gas expansion (free) | + | + | ✓ |
| Mixing | + | + | ✓ |
| Chemical equilibrium | + | + | ✓ |
| Radioactive decay | + | + | ✓ |

### 6.2.2 The Arrow of Time

Both frameworks explain temporal asymmetry:

```
ENTROPY VIEW:
Past (low S) -> Future (high S)
dS/dt > 0 defines direction

GUNA VIEW:
Past (Sattva) -> Future (Tamas)
dT/dt > 0 defines direction

IDENTICAL STRUCTURE
```

## 6.3 Life and Consciousness Results

### 6.3.1 Local Entropy Reduction

**Schrödinger's Finding:**
Living organisms maintain internal order by importing negentropy.

**Guna Interpretation:**
Living organisms maintain internal Sattva by importing order.

| Life Process | Entropy Effect | Guna Effect |
|--------------|----------------|-------------|
| Eating | Import low S | Import Sattva |
| Metabolism | Create structure | Increase local S |
| Excretion | Export high S | Export Tamas |
| Growth | Local S decrease | Local S increase |
| Death | S explosion | T dominates |

**Result: Complete structural match.**

### 6.3.2 Consciousness and Order

| Consciousness State | Entropy State | Guna State |
|---------------------|---------------|------------|
| Clarity (focus) | Low local S | High Sattva |
| Confusion | High S | High Tamas |
| Activity | Moderate S | High Rajas |
| Sleep (deep) | Low activity | Low Rajas |

## 6.4 Mathematical Correspondence

### 6.4.1 Boltzmann Formula Mapping

```
BOLTZMANN:
S = k·ln(W)

INTERPRETATION:
Entropy = k × log(number of disordered states)

GUNA MAPPING:
Tamas ∝ log(disorder)
More microstates = More Tamas

NORMALIZED:
T = ln(W) / ln(W_max)
```

### 6.4.2 Free Energy Mapping

```
HELMHOLTZ FREE ENERGY:
F = E - T·S (where T is temperature)

INTERPRETATION:
Free energy = Total - (Activity × Disorder)

GUNA MAPPING:
Available Shakti = Total - (Rajas × Tamas)
Useful work capacity decreases with disorder
```

### 6.4.3 Temperature-Activity Mapping

```
TEMPERATURE:
T_temp = (∂E/∂S)_V

MEANING:
Temperature = Rate of energy change with entropy

GUNA MAPPING:
Rajas = Rate of Tamas change with total Guna
Activity level at given disorder
```

## 6.5 Anomaly Resolution

### 6.5.1 Low-Entropy Early Universe

**Problem:** Why did the universe start with low entropy?

**Standard Physics:** No explanation (Past Hypothesis)

**Guna Framework:**
```
CYCLICAL MODEL:
Pralaya (dissolution) -> Srishti (creation) -> Sthiti (maintenance) -> Pralaya

After full Pralaya:
Tamas = maximum
But this IS the seed for new creation

New universe begins with:
High Sattva potential (ordered information compressed)
Like a compressed file about to expand
```

### 6.5.2 Maxwell's Demon

**Problem:** Can information violate Second Law?

**Resolution (Landauer/Bennett):**
Erasing information costs entropy.

**Guna Interpretation:**
Sattva (information) can reduce local Tamas
But processing/erasing increases global Tamas
No net violation

### 6.5.3 Fluctuation Theorems

**Problem:** Entropy can temporarily decrease

**Jarzynski Equality:**
⟨e^(-W/kT)⟩ = e^(-ΔF/kT)

**Guna Interpretation:**
Local Sattva increase is possible
Statistical fluctuations allowed
Average always toward Tamas

### 6.6.3 Mathematical Formulation

```
GUNA-THERMODYNAMIC EQUATIONS:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Tamas: T = S/S_max = k·ln(W)/k·ln(W_max)

Sattva: S = 1 - R - T (conservation)

Second Law: dT/dt ≥ 0
Conservation: S + R + T = 1

Life: dS_local/dt > 0 while dT_global/dt > 0
Consciousness: Increases local Sattva
