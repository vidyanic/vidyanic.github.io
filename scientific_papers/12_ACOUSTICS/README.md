## 💡 The Key Insight

**Cymatics proves the Vedic creation model:**

```
VEDIC CREATION SEQUENCE:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
1. Brahman (Consciousness)
2. Shabda (Sound/Vibration/OM)
3. Rupa (Form/Pattern)
4. Prakriti (Material)

CYMATICS PROVES STEPS 2->3:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Sound frequency -> Physical pattern
This is OBSERVABLE in experiments
Pour sand on a plate, vibrate it, watch patterns form!
```

**The universe wasn't created by random explosion.**
**It was sung into existence.**
