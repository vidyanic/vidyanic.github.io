# 05. Methodology: Experimental Approach

## 5.1 Research Design

### 5.1.1 Approach

This study employs:
1. **Experimental replication:** Reproduce classic cymatics experiments
2. **Pattern documentation:** Catalog frequency-pattern relationships
3. **Comparative analysis:** Match cymatic patterns to natural forms
4. **Literature correlation:** Align findings with Vedic claims
5. **Validation testing:** Apply 7-concept stack

## 5.2 Experimental Methods

### 5.2.1 Chladni Plate Method

**Equipment:**
- Metal plate (square or circular)
- Speaker/driver connected to plate center
- Frequency generator (signal source)
- Fine sand or powder
- Camera for documentation

**Procedure:**
1. Sprinkle sand evenly on plate
2. Apply sine wave at specific frequency
3. Observe sand movement to nodes
4. Document resulting pattern
5. Repeat at different frequencies

### 5.2.2 Water Cymatics

**Equipment:**
- Shallow dish of water
- Speaker beneath dish
- Frequency generator
- High-speed camera
- Good lighting

**Procedure:**
1. Fill dish with water
2. Apply frequency from below
3. Observe surface wave patterns
4. Photograph at peak formation
5. Catalog by frequency

### 5.2.3 CymaScope Method

**Equipment:**
- Specialized cymatics visualization device
- Water chamber
- LED lighting
- High-resolution camera

**Procedure:**
1. Apply sound/voice to chamber
2. Capture high-resolution image
3. Analyze pattern geometry
4. Compare across frequencies

## 5.3 Data Collection

### 5.3.1 Variables

| Variable | Type | Measurement |
|----------|------|-------------|
| Frequency (f) | Independent | Hz |
| Amplitude | Controlled | dB |
| Medium | Controlled | Type (sand, water) |
| Pattern | Dependent | Geometry |

### 5.3.2 Pattern Documentation

For each frequency tested:
- High-resolution photograph
- Geometric analysis (symmetry, nodes)
- Complexity rating (1-10)
- Natural form comparison
- Reproducibility check

---

## 5.4 Analysis Methods

### 5.4.1 Pattern Classification

Patterns categorized by:
- Number of nodal lines
- Symmetry type (radial, bilateral, etc.)
- Complexity level
- Resemblance to natural forms

### 5.4.2 Statistical Reproducibility

For each frequency:
- Run experiment 10+ times
- Document any variation
- Calculate consistency rate
- Expected: 100% reproducibility

### 5.4.3 Vedic Correlation

Compare findings with:
- Shabda Brahman doctrine
- Nada Yoga descriptions
- Mantra effects literature
- Creation cosmology

## 5.5 Validation Protocol (7-Concept Stack)

### Test Each Concept:

| # | Concept | Test Method |
|---|---------|-------------|
| 1 | Conservation | Energy conserved in vibration? |
| 2 | Entropy | Pattern organization from chaos? |
| 3 | Fractal | Self-similar at different scales? |
| 4 | Karma | Cause-effect (frequency-pattern)? |
| 5 | Observer | Does observation affect? |
| 6 | Cycles | Periodic patterns? |
| 7 | Gunas | Three quality types present? |

---

## 5.6 Limitations

### 5.6.1 Acknowledged Limitations

1. **Medium dependence:** Different media may show variation
2. **Amplitude effects:** Amplitude affects pattern clarity
3. **Equipment variation:** Different setups may vary slightly
4. **Biological inference:** Natural form resemblance is not proof of mechanism

### 5.6.2 Mitigation

1. Use standardized equipment
2. Control amplitude carefully
3. Document all conditions
4. Treat biological inference as hypothesis, not conclusion

---

## 5.7 Expected Outcomes

| Test | Expected Outcome |
|------|------------------|
| Reproducibility | 100% same frequency = same pattern |
| Complexity scaling | Higher Hz = more complex |
| Natural resemblance | Many patterns resemble biological forms |
| Vedic alignment | Strong correspondence |
