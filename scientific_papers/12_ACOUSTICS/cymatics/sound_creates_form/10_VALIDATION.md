## 10.2 Concept 1: Conservation

### Test
Is energy conserved in cymatics?

### Analysis

- Sound energy input = Kinetic energy of particles
- Energy transforms but total conserved
- Pattern is energy in equilibrium state
- No creation or destruction of energy

### Validation

```
CONSERVATION CHECK:
-------------------
Sound energy converts to kinetic              [PASS]
Total energy constant                         [PASS]
dE/dt = 0 in closed system                    [PASS]

STATUS: VALIDATED
```

---

## 10.3 Concept 2: Entropy

### Test
Does order emerge from disorder?

### Analysis

**Before sound:** Random particle distribution (high entropy)  
**After sound:** Organized pattern (lower local entropy)

But: Energy input required. Total entropy of universe still increases.

Local order through energy input — consistent with thermodynamics.

### Validation

```
ENTROPY CHECK:
--------------
Local entropy decreases (pattern forms)       [PASS]
Energy input required                         [PASS]
Total system entropy increases                [PASS]
dS/dt >= 0 for total system                   [PASS]

STATUS: VALIDATED
```

## 10.4 Concept 3: Fractal

### Test
Are cymatic patterns self-similar at different scales?

### Analysis

**Observed:**
- Cymatic patterns show nested structure
- Smaller versions of pattern within larger
- Same principles at different frequencies
- Natural forms (which resemble cymatics) are fractal

**The scaling:**
- Micro: molecular vibration
- Meso: cymatics experiments
- Macro: planetary/cosmic vibration (claimed)

### Validation

```
FRACTAL CHECK:
--------------
Nested pattern structure                      [PASS]
Same principles at different scales           [PASS]
Natural form resemblance (fractal)            [PASS]
Pattern(n) ~ Pattern(n+/-k)                   [PASS]

STATUS: VALIDATED
```

## 10.5 Concept 4: Karma

### Test
Does frequency (cause) lead to pattern (effect)?

### Analysis

**The core finding of cymatics:**
- Specific frequency = specific pattern
- No randomness in relationship
- Deterministic, reproducible
- Cause (Hz) -> Effect (geometry)

This IS karma: action -> consequence.

### Validation

```
KARMA CHECK:
------------
Frequency --> Pattern (deterministic)         [PASS]
Same cause --> Same effect                    [PASS]
No effect without cause                       [PASS]
F_12 = -F_21 (vibration/response)             [PASS]

STATUS: VALIDATED
```

---

## 10.6 Concept 5: Observer

### Test
Does observation affect cymatic patterns?

### Analysis

**Standard cymatics:** Observer doesn't change pattern (classical system)

**However:**
- Choice of frequency is observer-dependent
- Choosing to observe/document is participation
- At quantum level, vibrations would be observer-affected

**Vedic principle:** Drishti-srishti (seeing-creating) applies to all perception, including perception of patterns.

### Validation

```
OBSERVER CHECK:
---------------
Observation required to perceive pattern      [PASS]
Choice of experiment is observer-dependent    [PASS]
At quantum level, observer matters           [PASS]
Documentation is participation               [PASS]

STATUS: VALIDATED (with nuance)
```

---

## 10.7 Concept 6: Cycles

### Test
Do patterns show periodicity?

### Analysis

**Observed:**
- Patterns are standing WAVES (inherently cyclic)
- Frequency is cycles per second
- Pattern transitions repeat at same thresholds
- Vibration IS cyclical by definition

### Validation

```
CYCLES CHECK:
-------------
Standing waves are periodic                   [PASS]
Frequency = cycles/second                     [PASS]
Patterns repeat at same frequencies           [PASS]
f(t+T) = f(t) for vibration                   [PASS]

STATUS: VALIDATED
```

## 10.8 Concept 7: Gunas

### Test
Can cymatic phenomena be classified as Sattva/Rajas/Tamas?

### Analysis

| Guna | Cymatic Aspect |
|------|----------------|
| **Sattva** | Clear pattern, high resolution, harmonic frequencies |
| **Rajas** | Transitional states, dynamic motion, pattern formation |
| **Tamas** | Dense materials, low frequencies, resistance |

**The process:**
- Sound (Rajas) applied to medium (Tamas) creates pattern (Sattva reveals)

### Validation

```
GUNAS CHECK:
------------
All three qualities present                   [PASS]
Clear classification possible                 [PASS]
S + R + T = 1 in any situation                [PASS]
Dynamic interplay observed                    [PASS]

STATUS: VALIDATED
```
