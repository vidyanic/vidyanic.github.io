|----------------|--------------|-------|
| 20 | Simple radial, 2 nodes | Below audible |
| 50 | 4-node symmetry | Low bass |
| 100 | 8-node, flower-like | Bass |
| 200 | Complex radial | Mid-bass |
| 432 | Harmonious, aesthetic | "Natural" tuning |
| 440 | Standard tuning | Concert A |
| 528 | Complex, healing claimed | "DNA frequency" |
| 1000 | Very intricate | Mid-range |
| 5000 | Extremely detailed | High |

## Appendix B: DIY Cymatics Setup

### Basic Equipment

1. **Speaker driver** (subwoofer type)
2. **Metal plate** (square or circular, thin)
3. **Frequency generator** (app or device)
4. **Amplifier**
5. **Fine sand or powder**

### Setup Steps

1. Attach plate to speaker driver center
2. Connect speaker to amplifier
3. Connect amplifier to frequency generator
4. Sprinkle sand evenly on plate
5. Play pure sine wave at desired frequency
6. Observe pattern formation

### Safety

- Protect hearing at loud volumes
- Secure equipment to prevent falls
- Start at low volumes
