## 💡 The Key Insight

**Why does math work?**

Modern science: Unknown (Wigner's "unreasonable effectiveness")
Vedic view: Universe IS mathematical — Rta (cosmic order) is number

```
THE MATHEMATICAL UNIVERSE:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Brahman (Source)
    ↓
Shabda (Sound/Vibration)
    ↓
Rupa (Form/Geometry)
    ↓
Physical Reality

Sound → Form → Matter
This is why Cymatics works!
```
