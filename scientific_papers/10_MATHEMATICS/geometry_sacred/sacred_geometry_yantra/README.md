## Questions Answered

1. **Why do the same patterns appear everywhere?** -> They are the rendering algorithms
2. **What makes geometry "sacred"?** -> These are the blueprints of manifestation
3. **Is there a universal ratio?** -> Yes, φ (Phi) = 1.618... appears universally
4. **How does this connect to Vedic knowledge?** -> Sri Yantra, Vastu Mandala are maps of this

|   WHY SACRED GEOMETRY APPEARS EVERYWHERE:                           |
|                                                                     |
|   If reality is rendered (Maya), then:                              |
|   - There must be rendering algorithms                              |
|   - These algorithms produce consistent patterns                    |
|   - Sacred geometry IS those patterns made visible                  |
|                                                                     |
|   Phi, Fibonacci, Platonic Solids, Sri Yantra...                    |
|   These are the SOURCE CODE of manifestation.                       |
