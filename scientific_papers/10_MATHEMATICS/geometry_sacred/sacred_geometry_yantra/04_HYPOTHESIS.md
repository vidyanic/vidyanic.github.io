# 04. Hypothesis: Formal Claims

## 4.1 Primary Hypothesis

### H1: Sacred Geometry as Rendering Signature

**Statement:** Sacred geometric patterns (φ, Fibonacci, Platonic solids, Sri Yantra) are the visible signature of reality's rendering algorithms, not random coincidences.

**Formal Expression:**
```
Let R = Reality's rendering engine (Maya)
Let P = {φ, Fibonacci, Platonic, Yantra} = Sacred patterns

H1: P is output of R, not independent phenomenon
    P appears universally BECAUSE R is universal
```

**Testable Predictions:**
- Same patterns at all scales (fractal)
- Mathematical precision (not approximate)
- Universal occurrence (not local)
- Functional (not just decorative)

---

## 4.2 Secondary Hypotheses

### H2: Phi as Universal Constant

**Statement:** The golden ratio (φ) is a fundamental constant of the rendering engine, appearing wherever optimization or self-similarity is required.

**Evidence Required:**
- φ in quantum systems
- φ in biological growth
- φ in cosmic structures
- φ in human perception of beauty

### H3: Platonic Solids as Building Blocks

**Statement:** The 5 Platonic solids are the only stable 3D configurations, making them the fundamental building blocks of 3D rendering.

**Mathematical Proof:** Already proven — only 5 exist.

**Physical Correlation:**
- Atomic orbitals show related symmetries
- Crystal structures use these forms
- Molecular geometries follow these patterns

### H4: Vedic Correspondence

**Statement:** Ancient Vedic knowledge of sacred geometry (Yantra Vidya, Vastu) describes the same principles modern mathematics discovers.

**Evidence Required:**
- Sri Yantra mathematical precision matches modern calculations
- Vastu principles align with optimal proportions
- Temple geometry follows φ ratios

## 4.3 Null Hypotheses

### H0-1: Random Coincidence

**Statement:** The appearance of φ and other patterns in nature is coincidental.

**Counter-Evidence:**
- Too universal to be random
- Too precise to be approximate
- Appears at all scales (not local)

### H0-2: Confirmation Bias

**Statement:** We see patterns because we look for them, not because they're fundamental.

**Counter-Evidence:**
- Patterns are mathematically measurable
- Measurements are consistent across researchers
- Patterns exist whether observed or not

## 4.4 Operational Definitions

| Term | Operational Definition |
|------|----------------------|
| **Sacred Geometry** | Patterns appearing universally with mathematical precision |
| **Rendering Algorithm** | Rule that transforms potential into form |
| **Universal** | Appearing at multiple scales and domains |
| **Precise** | Measurable to multiple decimal places |
| **Functional** | Having effect on structure or consciousness |

---

## 4.5 Testability Criteria

### 4.5.1 Phi Universality Test

**Criterion:** For H2 to pass:
- φ must appear in at least 10 unrelated domains
- Measurements must be within 1% of 1.618
- Appearance must be functional, not decorative

### 4.5.2 Platonic Exclusivity Test

**Criterion:** For H3 to pass:
- No 6th Platonic solid should be constructible
- Physical structures should show these symmetries
- Elements should correlate (as claimed)

### 4.5.3 Vedic Precision Test

**Criterion:** For H4 to pass:
- Sri Yantra must be mathematically precise
- Vastu proportions must optimize function
- Correlations must exceed chance
