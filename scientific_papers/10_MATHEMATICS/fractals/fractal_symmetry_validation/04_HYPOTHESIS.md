# 4. HYPOTHESIS

---

## 4.1 Primary Hypothesis

**H₀ (Null):** Patterns at different scales are independent and unrelated; any apparent similarity is coincidental.

**H₁ (Alternative):** Reality exhibits fractal symmetry: Pattern(n) ≈ Pattern(n±k) for all levels n and displacements k, with Fractal Similarity Index (FSI) > 0.90.

## 4.2 Sub-Hypotheses

### H1a: Structural Similarity

```
CLAIM: Same structures exist at all levels

| Structure | Appears At |
|-----------|------------|
| Central axis | Brahman -> Atom |
| Concentric layers | Brahman -> Atom |
| 7+7 solid-fluid pattern | Cosmos -> Electron shells |

PREDICTION: FSI_structural > 0.90 for all level pairs
```

### H1b: Process Similarity

```
CLAIM: Same processes exist at all levels

| Process | Appears At |
|---------|------------|
| Create-Maintain-Destroy | All levels |
| Birth-Growth-Decay-Death | All levels |
| Energy transformation | All levels |

PREDICTION: FSI_functional > 0.90 for all level pairs
```

### H1c: Law Similarity

```
CLAIM: Same laws apply at all levels

| Law | Universal? |
|-----|-----------|
| Karma (action-reaction) | ✓ All levels |
| Gunas (S+R+T=1) | ✓ All levels |
| Conservation | ✓ All levels |
| Entropy increase | ✓ All levels |

PREDICTION: Laws validated at each level
```

### H1d: Scaling Similarity

```
CLAIM: Scaling ratios are preserved

| Ratio | Value |
|-------|-------|
| c = pixel/tick | Constant |
| Ring doubling | 2^n |
| Time containment | Parent > Child |

PREDICTION: FSI_scaling > 0.90 for all level pairs
```

## 4.3 Testable Predictions

| # | Prediction | Test Method | Pass Criterion |
|---|------------|-------------|----------------|
| 1 | Central axis exists at each level | Identify nucleus/core | Present at all 11 levels |
| 2 | Concentric structure at each level | Count layers | 7+ layers at most levels |
| 3 | Create-Maintain-Destroy at each level | Identify cycles | Present at all 11 levels |
| 4 | Gunas classifiable at each level | Categorize phenomena | S+R+T=1 verified |
| 5 | 5 elements at each level | Map elements | All 5 present |
| 6 | 6 stages at each level | Track lifecycle | All 6 stages |
| 7 | c preserved across scales | Calculate ratio | Within 10% |
| 8 | Parent-child time | Compare lifespans | Child < Parent always |

---

## 4.4 Falsification Criteria

The hypothesis would be **falsified** if:

1. ❌ More than 2 levels lack central axis
2. ❌ FSI < 0.80 for any level pair
3. ❌ c ratio varies by more than 20% between levels
4. ❌ Child outlives parent at any level
5. ❌ Gunas non-classifiable at any level
6. ❌ A level skips lifecycle stages

## 4.5 Expected Outcome

Based on preliminary analysis:

| Level Pair | Expected FSI |
|------------|--------------|
| Galaxy ↔ Solar | 0.95 |
| Solar ↔ Planet | 0.96 |
| Planet ↔ Human | 0.94 |
| Human ↔ Cell | 0.97 |
| Cell ↔ Molecule | 0.93 |
| Molecule ↔ Atom | 0.95 |
| Atom ↔ Quantum | 0.92 |

**Average Expected FSI: 0.946** (well above 0.90 threshold)
