## 💡 The Key Insight

**Modern cosmology:** Universe is 13.8 billion years old, will end in heat death
**Vedic cosmology:** Universe cycles through creation-maintenance-dissolution

```
MODERN VIEW              VEDIC VIEW
━━━━━━━━━━━              ━━━━━━━━━━
Big Bang → Heat Death    Brahma's Day → Night → Day...
Time is linear           Time is cyclic
Black holes = endpoints  Black holes = processing centers
Random structure         Fractal architecture
