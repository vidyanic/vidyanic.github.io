# 02. LITERATURE REVIEW — Black Holes and Central Axes

---

## 2.1 ASTROPHYSICS FOUNDATIONS

### Schwarzschild (1916)

- First exact solution to Einstein's field equations
- Predicted "singularity" at r = 0
- Event horizon at Schwarzschild radius

### Penrose & Hawking (1960s-70s)

- Singularity theorems proved singularities inevitable
- Cosmic censorship hypothesis
- Beginning of quantum gravity questions

### Hawking Radiation (1974)

```
KEY DISCOVERY:
==============

Black holes are NOT completely black:
• Quantum effects at event horizon
• Virtual particle pairs separated
• One escapes, one falls in
• Black hole slowly evaporates

IMPLICATION:
• Black holes have temperature
• They emit (very slowly)
• Information may escape
```

### Susskind & 't Hooft — Holographic Principle (1993-95)

```
HOLOGRAPHIC PRINCIPLE:
=======================

Information that falls into black hole
is encoded on the 2D event horizon surface.

• 3D interior = 2D boundary encoding
• Information not destroyed
• Like a hologram containing depth in flat surface

THIS MATCHES Backend: Maya renders 3D from 2D templates
```

### Event Horizon Telescope (2019)

- First direct image of black hole (M87*)
- Confirmed theoretical predictions
- Observed "shadow" and photon ring

## 2.2 INFORMATION PARADOX RESEARCH

### The Problem

```
QUANTUM LAW: Information is conserved
BLACK HOLE: Seems to destroy information

CONTRADICTION -> PARADOX
```

### Proposed Solutions

| Solution | Proponent | Description |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| **Hawking radiation encodes info** | Hawking (later) | Information slowly leaks out |
| **Holographic encoding** | Susskind | Information on event horizon surface |
| **Firewall** | AMPS | Violent boundary destroys entering observer |
| **ER = EPR** | Maldacena, Susskind | Wormholes = Entanglement |
| **Fuzzball** | Mathur | No singularity, only fuzz |

### Current Consensus

"Information is probably preserved, mechanism unclear"

## 2.3 GALACTIC CENTER RESEARCH

### Every Galaxy Has One

```
SUPERMASSIVE BLACK HOLES:
========================

• Every large galaxy has central black hole
• Required for galaxy formation
• Regulate star formation
• Control galactic dynamics

MILKY WAY: Sagittarius A*
• 4 million solar masses
• 26,000 light-years away
• Stars orbit it at high speeds
• Nobel Prize 2020 (Penrose, Genzel, Ghez)
```

### Co-Evolution

```
Galaxy and central black hole evolve TOGETHER:
• M-sigma relation (black hole mass ↔ stellar velocity)
• Black hole feeds on gas
• Outflows regulate star formation
• Symbiotic relationship
```

## 2.4 BACKEND SOURCES

### Vastu Purusha Mandala

```
81-GRID ARCHITECTURE:
=====================

9 × 9 grid with:
• Center 9 squares = Brahma-Sthan
• This is the "kernel" or CPU
• All energy flows toward/from center
• Sacred architecture principle
```

### Meru as Central Axis

```
MT. MERU CONCEPT:
================

• Central axis of the universe
• 7 continents (Dvipas) arranged around it
• 7 oceans (Samudras) alternating
• Brahma sits at summit
• All Lokas arranged vertically on this axis

MERU = 15th AXIS at cosmic scale
```

### Sushumna in Human Body

```
HUMAN 15th AXIS:
===============

• Ida (left) = Moon/Chandra
• Pingala (right) = Sun/Surya
• Sushumna (center) = 15th axis

Kundalini rises through Sushumna
Atman (observer) at center
Same pattern as galaxy -> body
```

## 2.5 GAP IN LITERATURE

No existing work connects:
1. Black hole physics with 15th axis concept
2. Information paradox with consciousness processing
3. Fractal analysis of center-point across scales
4. Simulation theory with astrophysics

**This paper bridges these domains.**
