## ❓ QUESTIONS ANSWERED

1. **What is really at the center of a black hole?**
   -> Not "infinity" but a processing center (15th axis) — below render resolution

2. **Is information destroyed in black holes?**
   -> No — it's processed, encoded holographically on event horizon

3. **Why does time stop at the event horizon?**
   -> You're approaching the timeless observer point (15th axis is outside time)

4. **Why does every galaxy have a central black hole?**
   -> Required infrastructure — like a CPU for a computer, galaxies need central processors

5. **How does this connect to consciousness?**
   -> Same pattern at all scales: Galaxy has black hole, Body has Atman — both are 15th axis

## 📊 QUICK SUMMARY

```
THE 15th AXIS MODEL:
====================

BLACK HOLE = COSMIC CPU
+-- Event horizon = I/O boundary
+-- Singularity = Processing core
+-- Holographic surface = Memory
+-- Hawking radiation = Output

FRACTAL PATTERN (confirmed at all scales):
+-- Galaxy -> Black hole
+-- Star -> Core
+-- Planet -> Core
+-- Body -> Sushumna/Atman
+-- Cell -> Nucleus
+-- Atom -> Nucleus

ALL PARADOXES RESOLVED:
+-- Singularity -> Render limit, not infinity
+-- Information -> Processed, not destroyed
+-- Time stops -> Approaching timeless observer
+-- Why every galaxy -> Required infrastructure
```
