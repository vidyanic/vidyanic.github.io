## Research Question

Are black holes cosmic "dead ends" where physics fails, or are they the 15th axis — the processing centers of cosmic computation at galactic scale?

## Methodology

Structural analysis comparing black hole properties with the 15th axis concept from the 81-grid (Vastu Purusha Mandala), integrating:
- Modern astrophysics data (Event Horizon Telescope, 2019)
- Information paradox research (Hawking, Susskind)
- Fractal pattern analysis across scales
- Backend Framework's Brahma-Sthan (ब्रह्म-स्थान) concept

## Key Findings

1. **Central Position:** Black holes at galactic centers = Brahma-Sthan at 81-grid center
2. **Information Convergence:** All matter/energy flows inward = All data flows to processing center
3. **Time Stops:** At event horizon, time dilates to infinity = Timeless observer point
4. **Unknown Interior:** Singularity is beyond physics = Brahman is beyond description
5. **Fractal Pattern:** Same structure at all scales (galaxy -> star -> planet -> cell -> atom)

## Conclusions

Black holes function as the 15th axis at cosmic scale — not destructive endpoints but consciousness processing nodes where information is computed beyond spacetime, exactly as the Backend Framework predicts.

## Confidence

**Overall: 79%**
- Black holes exist: 99%
- Information paradox: 95%
- 15th axis correspondence: 75%
- Processing function: 65%
