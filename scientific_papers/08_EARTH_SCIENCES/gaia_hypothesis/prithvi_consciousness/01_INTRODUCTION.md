## 1.1 The Living Earth Question

### 1.1.1 The Modern Discovery

James Lovelock (1970s) proposed:
- Earth behaves like a living organism
- Atmosphere, oceans, life interact
- System maintains conditions for life
- Named "Gaia" after Greek goddess

### 1.1.2 The Ancient Knowledge

Vedic civilization always knew:
- Earth is Bhumi Devi (भूमि देवी)
- A goddess, conscious, sacred
- Mother of all creatures
- Deserving worship, not exploitation

---

## 1.2 Why This Matters

### 1.2.1 Environmental Crisis

Current relationship with Earth:
- Resource extraction
- Pollution
- Species extinction
- Climate destabilization

If Earth is ALIVE:
- We are harming a living being
- Not just resource mismanagement
- Ethical/spiritual implications

### 1.2.2 Paradigm Shift

From: Earth as dead matter to exploit
To: Earth as living system to respect

## 1.3 Gaia Versions

### 1.3.1 Weak Gaia (Accepted)

```
WEAK GAIA:
==========
- Life affects environment
- Environment affects life
- Co-evolution occurs
- Feedback loops exist

STATUS: Scientifically accepted
```

### 1.3.2 Strong Gaia (Controversial)

```
STRONG GAIA:
============
- Earth actively regulates
- Purposeful homeostasis
- System has "goals"
- Like an organism

STATUS: Debated
```

### 1.3.3 Vedic View (Beyond Both)

```
VEDIC PRITHVI:
==============
- Earth is conscious (not just alive)
- Has will and purpose (Dharma)
- Responds to treatment
- Part of cosmic hierarchy

STATUS: Beyond current science
```
