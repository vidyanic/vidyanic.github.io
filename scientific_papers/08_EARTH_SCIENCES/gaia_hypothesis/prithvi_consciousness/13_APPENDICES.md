## Appendix B: Earth System Parameters

### B.1 Atmospheric Composition

| Gas | Percentage | Status |
|-----|------------|--------|
| N₂ | 78.08% | Stable |
| O₂ | 20.95% | Biologically maintained |
| Ar | 0.93% | Stable |
| CO₂ | 0.04% | Rising (human cause) |

### B.2 Ocean Chemistry

| Parameter | Value | Stability |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Salinity | 35 ppt | Billions years |

## Appendix C: Feedback Systems

### C.1 Silicate Weathering

```
CO₂ + CaSiO₃ → CaCO₃ + SiO₂

Temperature ↑ → Weathering ↑ → CO₂ ↓ → Cooling
Negative feedback loop
```

### C.2 CLAW Hypothesis

```
Phytoplankton → DMS (dimethyl sulfide)
DMS → Atmosphere → Cloud condensation nuclei
Clouds → Increased albedo → Cooling

Biotic regulation of climate
```
