## 10.2 Concept 1: Conservation

### Test
Is energy/matter conserved in the Gaia system?

### Analysis
- Earth is essentially a closed system for matter
- Energy input (Sun) = Energy output (radiation)
- Nutrients cycle continuously
- Nothing truly lost, only transformed

### Validation

```
CONSERVATION CHECK:
-------------------
Matter cycles continuously                    [PASS]
Energy balanced (input = output)              [PASS]
Nutrients recycled                            [PASS]

STATUS: VALIDATED
```

---

## 10.3 Concept 2: Entropy

### Test
How does Gaia manage entropy?

### Analysis
- Life creates local order (decreases local entropy)
- Powered by solar energy input
- Death and decay return to entropy
- Net entropy of universe still increases
- Gaia maintains far-from-equilibrium state

### Validation

```
ENTROPY CHECK:
--------------
Life creates order locally                    [PASS]
Solar energy enables anti-entropy             [PASS]
Overall entropy still increases               [PASS]

STATUS: VALIDATED
```

---

## 10.4 Concept 3: Fractal

### Test
Is the Gaia pattern self-similar at different scales?

### Analysis
- Individual organisms self-regulate (homeostasis)
- Ecosystems self-regulate
- Biomes self-regulate
- Planetary Gaia self-regulates
- Same pattern: life maintaining life conditions

### Validation

```
FRACTAL CHECK:
--------------
Cell -- Organism -- Ecosystem -- Planet       [PASS]
Self-regulation at each scale                 [PASS]
Pattern(organism) ~ Pattern(planet)           [PASS]

STATUS: VALIDATED
```

---

## 10.5 Concept 4: Karma

### Test
Do actions have consequences in the Gaia system?

### Analysis
- Pollution -> Ecosystem damage
- Deforestation -> Climate change
- CO2 emissions -> Global warming
- Conservation -> Recovery
- Every action affects the whole system

### Validation

```
KARMA CHECK:
------------
Actions have environmental consequences       [PASS]
Harm returns as damage                        [PASS]
Care returns as health                        [PASS]

STATUS: VALIDATED
```

---

## 10.6 Concept 5: Observer

### Test
Does observation matter in the Gaia system?

### Analysis
- Scientific observation changed our understanding
- Human awareness of Gaia shapes behavior
- Measurement affects what we measure (ecology)
- Consciousness observing Earth changes relationship

### Validation

```
OBSERVER CHECK:
---------------
Awareness of Gaia changes human behavior      [PASS]
Observation reveals self-regulation           [PASS]
Consciousness affects relationship            [PASS]

STATUS: VALIDATED (with nuance)
```

---

## 10.7 Concept 6: Cycles

### Test
Are there cycles in the Gaia system?

### Analysis
- Carbon cycle
- Nitrogen cycle
- Water cycle
- Oxygen cycle
- Geological cycles
- Ice ages and warm periods
- All cyclic, all repeating

### Validation

```
CYCLES CHECK:
-------------
Biogeochemical cycles documented              [PASS]
Climate cycles present                        [PASS]
f(t+T) = f(t) for major cycles               [PASS]

STATUS: VALIDATED (Core of Gaia)
```

---

## 10.8 Concept 7: Gunas

### Test
Can Gaia phenomena be classified by Gunas?

### Analysis
- **Sattva:** Life, growth, harmony, balance
- **Rajas:** Change, evolution, succession
- **Tamas:** Decay, death, recycling

### Validation

```
GUNAS CHECK:
------------
Life/growth = Sattva                          [PASS]
Change/evolution = Rajas                      [PASS]
Decay/death = Tamas                           [PASS]
S + R + T = 1 in ecosystem                    [PASS]

STATUS: VALIDATED
```
