# 4. Hypothesis

---

## 4.1 Primary Hypothesis

**H₁:** Earth functions as a self-regulating living system (Gaia) with emergent consciousness, corresponding to the Vedic understanding of Bhumi Devi.

---

## 4.2 Sub-Hypotheses

### H₂: Self-Regulation
Earth actively maintains conditions suitable for life through biological-geological feedback systems.
**Status:** Well-supported by evidence.

### H₃: Emergent Properties
Earth system displays emergent properties not predictable from parts alone.
**Status:** Supported.

### H₄: Distributed Consciousness
Earth has a form of distributed consciousness arising from the integration of all living systems.
**Status:** Speculative but philosophically coherent.

### H₅: Response to Treatment
Earth responds to human actions not just mechanically but meaningfully (karma-like).
**Status:** Difficult to test directly.

## 4.3 Predictions

| If True | Observable |
|---------|------------|
| Self-regulation | Homeostatic recovery from perturbation |
| Consciousness | Meaningful patterns in Earth responses |
| Response to treatment | Correlation between human ethics and Earth health |

---

## 4.4 Falsification

Hypothesis weakened if:
1. No self-regulation observed
2. Purely mechanical explanations sufficient
3. No purpose evident in Earth behavior
