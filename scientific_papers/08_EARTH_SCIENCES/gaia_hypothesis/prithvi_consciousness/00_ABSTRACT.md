## Research Question

Is Earth a self-regulating living system, and does Vedic understanding of Prithvi (पृथ्वी) as conscious Bhumi Devi align with the Gaia hypothesis?

---

## Hypothesis

**H₁:** Earth functions as a self-regulating living system (Gaia), corresponding to the Vedic understanding of Prithvi as a conscious being (Bhumi Devi).

---

## Key Findings

| Gaia Hypothesis | Vedic Prithvi | Scientific Evidence |
|-----------------|---------------|---------------------|
| Earth self-regulates | Bhumi has Dharma | Homeostasis confirmed |
| Atmosphere regulated | Prithvi breathes | O₂, CO₂ balance |
| Life modifies environment | Jivas serve Earth | Verified |
| System has boundaries | Loka boundaries | Magnetosphere |
