## 2.2 Scientific Evidence

### 2.2.1 Atmospheric Regulation

```
ATMOSPHERIC HOMEOSTASIS:
========================

O₂ maintained at ~21% for 200M years
- Too high: Fires uncontrollable
- Too low: Animals die
- Biological regulation evident

CO₂ regulated (until human intervention)
- Weathering feedback
- Biological sequestration
- Ocean absorption
```

### 2.2.2 Temperature Regulation

- Faint young sun paradox
- Sun 30% dimmer 4 billion years ago
- Earth should have frozen
- Yet life existed — temperature regulated

### 2.2.3 Ocean Salinity

- Stays at ~3.4% for billions of years
- Despite salt input from rivers
- Biological/geological removal
- Homeostatic maintenance
