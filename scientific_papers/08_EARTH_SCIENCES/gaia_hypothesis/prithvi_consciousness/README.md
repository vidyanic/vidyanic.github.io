## Questions Answered

1. **Is Earth alive?** -> It functions as a self-regulating living system
2. **Is Earth conscious?** -> Vedic view: Yes, Bhumi Devi is conscious
3. **How does it self-regulate?** -> Complex biological-geological feedback loops
4. **What are the implications?** -> We are part of a living being, not owners of dead matter

|   GAIA HYPOTHESIS (MODERN):                                         |
|   Earth functions as a self-regulating living system.               |
|   Atmosphere, oceans, land, and life interact to maintain           |
|   conditions suitable for life. "Gaia" = Earth as organism.         |
|                                                                     |
|   VEDIC UNDERSTANDING:                                              |
|   Bhumi Devi is a goddess—Earth is conscious, sacred, alive.        |
|   She is our mother. We are her children, not her owners.           |
|   The planet has Prana (life force) and Dharma (purpose).           |
|                                                                     |
|   SYNTHESIS:                                                        |
|   Gaia = Scientific validation of Vedic Earth-Mother concept.       |
|   Earth is not dead matter we exploit; Earth is alive.              |
|   Our environmental crisis = harming a living being.                |
|                                                                     |
