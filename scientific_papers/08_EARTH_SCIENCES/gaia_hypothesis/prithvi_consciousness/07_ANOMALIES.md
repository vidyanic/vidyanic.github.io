## 7.1 Mass Extinctions

### 7.1.1 The Problem

If Earth self-regulates, why mass extinctions?
- 5 major extinction events
- Up to 96% species loss (Permian)
- Seems like system failure

### 7.1.2 Resolution

Gaia regulates for LIFE, not specific species:
- System recovers after extinction
- Different life emerges
- Overall biosphere persists
- Like immune response (local damage, global survival)

## 7.2 Climate Extremes

### 7.2.1 Snowball Earth

~700 million years ago:
- Earth possibly frozen solid
- How did life survive?
- Why didn't regulation prevent it?

### 7.2.2 Response

- Regulation has limits
- External forcing (volcanic, orbital) can overwhelm
- System eventually recovers
- Not perfect thermostat, but resilient

## 7.3 Current Crisis

### 7.3.1 Human Impact

- Climate change accelerating
- Biodiversity collapsing
- Is Gaia failing?

### 7.3.2 Interpretation

Two views:
1. **Gaia is being harmed** — We're damaging a living being
2. **Gaia will respond** — Possibly by removing the threat (us)

Vedic view: Karma. Actions have consequences.

## 7.4 Consciousness Evidence Gap

### 7.4.1 The Challenge

How to prove Earth consciousness?
- No direct communication
- No clear intention signals
- Hard to operationalize

### 7.4.2 Possible Evidence

- Meaningful patterns (hard to distinguish from mechanism)
- Response to collective human consciousness
- Correlations with global meditation/intention
