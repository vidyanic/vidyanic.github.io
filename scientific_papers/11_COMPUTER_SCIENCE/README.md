## 💡 The Key Insight

**Elon Musk:** "Odds are billions to one we're NOT in a simulation"
**Vedas:** "All this is Maya"

```
SIMULATION THEORY        ↔        MAYA DOCTRINE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━               ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
We're in a computer              We're in Maya
Substrate = unknown              Brahman = consciousness
Player = consciousness           Atman = consciousness
Glitches = anomalies             Siddhis = exploits
Exit = death/enlightenment       Moksha = liberation
```

**The map was always there. We just called it "philosophy."**

**Caution:** This paper is more philosophical than empirical. The hypothesis may be unfalsifiable — but so is Maya.
