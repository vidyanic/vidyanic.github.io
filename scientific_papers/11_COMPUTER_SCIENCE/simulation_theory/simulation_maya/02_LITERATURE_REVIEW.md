# 02. Literature Review: Modern and Ancient Sources

## 2.1 Modern Simulation Theory Literature

### 2.1.1 Foundational Works

**Nick Bostrom (2003)** — "Are You Living in a Computer Simulation?"
- Introduced the formal simulation argument
- Statistical reasoning: simulated beings outnumber "real" ones
- Sparked serious academic discourse
- Published in Philosophical Quarterly

**David Chalmers (2010)** — "The Matrix as Metaphysics"
- Explored simulation as legitimate metaphysical possibility
- Argued simulated reality is still "real" for inhabitants
- Distinguished types of simulation hypotheses

**Robin Hanson (2001)** — "How to Live in a Simulation"
- Practical implications if we're simulated
- Behavior optimization strategies
- Game-theoretic analysis

### 2.1.2 Physics-Based Arguments

**John Wheeler (1989)** — "Information, Physics, Quantum"
- "It from bit" paradigm
- Reality as information processing
- Observer-participancy

**Max Tegmark (2014)** — "Our Mathematical Universe"
- External Reality Hypothesis
- Universe IS mathematical structure
- Computational equivalence

**Seth Lloyd (2006)** — "Programming the Universe"
- Universe as quantum computer
- Computation as fundamental
- Information theory of physics

### 2.1.3 Popular Discourse

**Elon Musk (2016):** "One in billions chance we're in base reality"
**Neil deGrasse Tyson (2016):** "50-50 odds we're simulated"
**Various physicists:** Exploring holographic principle implications

## 2.2 Vedic Literature on Maya

### 2.2.1 Primary Texts

**Rig Veda (c. 1500 BCE)**
- Maya as divine creative power
- Indra uses Maya to manifest forms
- Original source of concept

**Upanishads (c. 800-200 BCE)**

*Mandukya Upanishad:*
> "All this is Brahman. This Atman is Brahman."

*Chandogya Upanishad:*
> "Tat tvam asi" — You are That

*Brihadaranyaka Upanishad:*
> World as projection of Brahman's creative power

**Bhagavad Gita (c. 200 BCE)**
> "मायां तु प्रकृतिं विद्यान्मायिनं च महेश्वरम्"  
> "Know Maya as Prakriti, and the Lord as the one wielding Maya."  
> — 7.14

### 2.2.2 Philosophical Treatises

**Gaudapada's Karika (c. 6th century)**
- Ajativada: Nothing is ever born
- World as dream projection
- Four states of consciousness analysis

**Shankara's Vivekachudamani (c. 8th century)**
- Systematic Maya analysis
- Brahman-Atman identity
- Liberation methodology

**Yoga Vasishtha (c. 10th century)**
- World as cosmic dream
- Extended simulation metaphors
- Practical liberation paths

## 2.3 Comparative Studies

### 2.3.1 Academic Comparisons

| Author | Work | Contribution |
|--------|------|--------------|
| Heinrich Zimmer | "Philosophies of India" | Maya as cosmic magic |
| Eliot Deutsch | "Advaita Vedanta: A Philosophical Reconstruction" | Technical Maya analysis |
| Swami Vivekananda | "Jnana Yoga" | Maya for Western audience |
| David Loy | "Nonduality" | Cross-tradition comparison |

### 2.3.2 Simulation-Maya Comparisons

Few formal academic works directly compare:
- Most discussions occur in popular philosophy
- Some transhumanist literature touches this
- Vedantic scholars largely unaware of simulation theory
- Computer scientists largely unaware of Maya concept

**This paper fills a significant gap in the literature.**

## 2.4 Key Concepts from Literature

### From Simulation Theory:

```
1. Substrate Independence
   - Consciousness doesn't require biological matter
   - Can be simulated on any suitable medium

2. Ancestor Simulations  
   - Simulating historical civilizations
   - Including conscious beings

3. Simulation Stack
   - Simulations within simulations
   - Potentially infinite regression

4. Base Reality
   - The "real" level (if it exists)
   - Running all simulations
```

### From Maya Vidya:

```
1. Adhyasa (Superimposition)
   - False appears upon real
   - Snake-rope analogy

2. Vivarta (Apparent Transformation)
   - Brahman appears as world
   - Without actual change

3. Avidya (Ignorance)
   - Not knowing one's true nature
   - Root cause of bondage

4. Moksha (Liberation)
   - Recognizing truth
   - "Exit" from identification
```

## 2.5 Literature Gaps Addressed

This paper addresses:

1. **No formal mapping** exists between simulation concepts and Maya concepts
2. **Physics evidence** has not been systematically correlated with Maya descriptions
3. **The "who runs it" question** has not been resolved through comparison
4. **Practical implications** for liberation remain unexplored in computational terms

## 2.6 Methodology Derived from Literature

From reviewed sources, we derive:

1. **Structural Comparison:** Map corresponding concepts
2. **Functional Analysis:** Compare how each explains reality
3. **Phenomenological Correlation:** Align physics observations
4. **Axiological Examination:** Compare purposes/values
5. **Validation:** Test against established frameworks
