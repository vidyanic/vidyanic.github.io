# 05. Methodology: Comparative and Phenomenological Analysis

## 5.1 Research Design

### 5.1.1 Approach

This study employs a **mixed-methods comparative analysis**:

1. **Conceptual Mapping:** Systematic comparison of terminology
2. **Structural Analysis:** Comparison of explanatory frameworks
3. **Phenomenological Correlation:** Alignment with observed physics
4. **Hermeneutical Synthesis:** Integration of interpretations
5. **Validation Testing:** Application of 7-concept stack

### 5.1.2 Research Questions

| # | Question | Method |
|---|----------|--------|
| RQ1 | Do concepts map? | Conceptual mapping |
| RQ2 | Do structures align? | Structural analysis |
| RQ3 | Do physics match? | Phenomenological correlation |
| RQ4 | Is exit documented? | Textual analysis |
| RQ5 | Does framework validate? | 7-concept stack |

## 5.2 Conceptual Mapping Protocol

### 5.2.1 Procedure

For each simulation theory concept:
1. Define concept precisely using source literature
2. Identify functional role in framework
3. Search Vedic literature for equivalent function
4. Define Vedic concept using primary texts
5. Assess correspondence strength (0-100%)
6. Document any discrepancies

### 5.2.2 Mapping Template

```
CONCEPT: [Modern Term]
DEFINITION: [From simulation theory literature]
FUNCTION: [Role in framework]

VEDIC EQUIVALENT: [Sanskrit term]
DEFINITION: [From Vedic texts]
FUNCTION: [Role in Maya framework]

CORRESPONDENCE: [0-100%]
DISCREPANCY: [If any]
```

### 5.2.3 Example Application

```
CONCEPT: Simulation
DEFINITION: Computed model of reality with conscious experiencers
FUNCTION: What we experience as "reality"

VEDIC EQUIVALENT: Maya/Jagat
DEFINITION: Rendered appearance projected upon Brahman
FUNCTION: What we experience as "reality"

CORRESPONDENCE: 95%
DISCREPANCY: Maya includes purpose (Lila); modern theory uncertain
```

## 5.3 Structural Analysis Protocol

### 5.3.1 Framework Components

For each framework, identify:
- **Substrate:** What underlies reality
- **Mechanism:** How reality is generated
- **Experience:** How it's perceived
- **Exit:** How to transcend
- **Purpose:** Why it exists

### 5.3.2 Comparison Matrix

| Component | Modern Simulation | Maya Vidya |
|-----------|------------------|------------|
| Substrate | Computing hardware | Brahman |
| Mechanism | Computation | Maya rendering |
| Experience | User/Avatar | Jiva |
| Exit | Unknown/hack | Moksha |
| Purpose | Unknown | Lila (play) |

## 5.4 Phenomenological Correlation

### 5.4.1 Physics Phenomena Selection

Select quantum phenomena cited as simulation evidence:
1. Wave function superposition
2. Measurement collapse
3. Quantum entanglement
4. Planck scale limits
5. Speed of light limit
6. Fine-tuned constants
7. Observer effect

### 5.4.2 Correlation Procedure

For each phenomenon:
1. Describe from physics perspective
2. State simulation interpretation
3. Identify Maya framework explanation
4. Assess alignment
5. Note any predictions unique to either

## 5.5 Textual Analysis Protocol

### 5.5.1 Primary Sources

**Modern:**
- Bostrom (2003)
- Chalmers (2010)
- Wheeler (1989)
- Lloyd (2006)

**Vedic:**
- Rig Veda
- Mandukya Upanishad
- Vivekachudamani
- Yoga Vasishtha
- Bhagavad Gita

### 5.5.2 Analysis Criteria

- Direct statements about reality's nature
- Descriptions of mechanism
- Prescriptions for liberation/exit
- Philosophical implications

## 5.6 Validation Protocol (7-Concept Stack)

### 5.6.1 Validation Requirements

Every major claim must satisfy:

| # | Concept | Check | Pass Criteria |
|---|---------|-------|---------------|
| 1 | Conservation | Energy/info preserved | Maya neither creates nor destroys Brahman |
| 2 | Entropy | System tends to disorder | Tamas increases over time |
| 3 | Fractal | Self-similar patterns | Same structure at all levels |
| 4 | Karma | Action-reaction | Every action has consequence |
| 5 | Observer | Observation matters | Drishti-srishti principle |
| 6 | Cycles | Periodicity exists | Yugas, creation-dissolution |
| 7 | Gunas | Three qualities | S+R+T=1 always |

### 5.6.2 Validation Procedure

For the core thesis:
1. State thesis clearly
2. Test against each concept
3. Document compliance/violation
4. Calculate overall validation score

## 5.7 Limitations

### 5.7.1 Acknowledged Limitations

1. **Translation issues:** Vedic concepts may not map exactly
2. **Interpretation variance:** Multiple schools interpret Maya differently
3. **Falsifiability:** Neither theory easily falsified
4. **Bias risk:** Author may favor correspondence

### 5.7.2 Mitigation Strategies

1. Use multiple translation sources
2. Acknowledge interpretation differences
3. Focus on functional equivalence
4. Explicitly test for disconfirmation
