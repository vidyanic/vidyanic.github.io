## 10.2 Concept 1: Conservation

### Test
Does the simulation/Maya framework preserve energy and information?

### Analysis

**Maya Framework:**
- Brahman is unchanging — nothing added or removed
- Maya transforms appearance, not substance
- Information is conserved in Akashic records
- Energy transforms but total constant

**Simulation:**
- Simulated universe conserves simulated energy
- Information is always preserved (computation is reversible in principle)

### Validation

```
CONSERVATION CHECK:
-------------------
Brahman (substrate) = constant             [PASS]
Maya transforms but doesn't create/destroy [PASS]
dE/dt = 0 within the rendered system       [PASS]
Information preserved in karma logs        [PASS]

STATUS: VALIDATED
```

---

## 10.3 Concept 2: Entropy

### Test
Does the framework account for entropy increase?

### Analysis

**Maya Framework:**
- Tamas (inertia) increases over time
- Yugas progress from Satya (order) to Kali (disorder)
- Manifestation tends toward dissolution (Pralaya)
- Local decreases possible, global increase inevitable

**Physics:**
- Second law of thermodynamics
- dS/dt >= 0

### Validation

```
ENTROPY CHECK:
--------------
Tamas increases over time                  [PASS]
Yugas show decreasing order               [PASS]
Local order possible within global trend  [PASS]
dS/dt >= 0 maintained                     [PASS]

STATUS: VALIDATED
```

## 10.4 Concept 3: Fractal

### Test
Is the framework self-similar at all scales?

### Analysis

**Fractal Pattern:**

| Scale | Observer | Observed | Rendering |
|-------|----------|----------|-----------|
| Cosmic | Brahman | Jagat | Maya |
| Human | Atman | Body-Mind | Avidya |
| Cellular | Cell consciousness | Cell world | Cell perception |
| Quantum | Observer | System | Measurement |

**Same pattern at every level:**
- Observer witnesses
- Rendering occurs
- Appearance manifests
- Identity question arises

### Validation

```
FRACTAL CHECK:
--------------
Macro-micro isomorphism                    [PASS]
Pattern(observer/observed/rendering)       [PASS]
Same structure at quantum/human/cosmic     [PASS]
Pattern(n) ~ Pattern(n+/-k)                [PASS]

STATUS: VALIDATED
```

## 10.5 Concept 4: Karma

### Test
Does action lead to reaction? Is causality maintained?

### Analysis

**Karma in Framework:**
- Every action logged
- Consequences ripple out
- Past karma creates present circumstances
- No action without reaction

**Dharma Rules:**
- Physics laws = Dharmic laws
- Causality is fundamental
- F = -F (Newton's third law)

### Validation

```
KARMA CHECK:
------------
Action --> Consequence mapping             [PASS]
Karma logging system (Akashic)            [PASS]
Past actions affect present               [PASS]
F_12 = -F_21 (action-reaction)            [PASS]

STATUS: VALIDATED
```

---

## 10.6 Concept 5: Observer

### Test
Does observation affect the observed?

### Analysis

**Central to This Paper:**
- Drishti-srishti: seeing creates
- Quantum measurement: observation collapses
- Reality rendered on observation
- Consciousness essential to manifestation

**Evidence:**
- Double-slit experiment
- Delayed choice experiment
- Quantum Zeno effect
- Observer-dependent reality

### Validation

```
OBSERVER CHECK:
---------------
Observation triggers rendering             [PASS]
Wave function collapse                     [PASS]
|psi|^2 = P (probability on observation)  [PASS]
Reality observer-dependent                 [PASS]

STATUS: VALIDATED (This is core thesis)
```

---

## 10.7 Concept 6: Cycles

### Test
Does the framework include periodicity?

### Analysis

**Cosmic Cycles:**
- Yugas: Satya -> Treta -> Dwapara -> Kali -> repeat
- Kalpas: Creation -> Maintenance -> Dissolution -> repeat
- Manvantaras: Cosmic day-night cycles

**In Simulation Terms:**
- System boot -> Run -> Shutdown -> Reboot
- Game start -> Play -> Game over -> New game

### Validation

```
CYCLES CHECK:
-------------
Yuga cycles present                        [PASS]
Creation-dissolution cycles                [PASS]
Samsara (individual reincarnation cycles)  [PASS]
f(t+T) = f(t) pattern                     [PASS]

STATUS: VALIDATED
```

## 10.8 Concept 7: Gunas

### Test
Can all phenomena be classified as Sattva/Rajas/Tamas combinations?

### Analysis

**Guna Application:**

| Aspect | Sattva | Rajas | Tamas |
|--------|--------|-------|-------|
| Simulation | Clear rendering | Active processing | Material manifestation |
| Physics | Light/EM | Motion/Energy | Mass/Gravity |
| Consciousness | Clarity | Activity | Obscuration |
| Experience | Peace | Passion | Ignorance |

**Constraint:**
- S + R + T = 1 (always)
- Every phenomenon is a mixture
- No pure S, R, or T alone in manifestation

### Validation

```
GUNAS CHECK:
------------
All phenomena classifiable                 [PASS]
Rendering uses three modes                 [PASS]
S + R + T = 1 always                      [PASS]
No exceptions found                        [PASS]

STATUS: VALIDATED
```
