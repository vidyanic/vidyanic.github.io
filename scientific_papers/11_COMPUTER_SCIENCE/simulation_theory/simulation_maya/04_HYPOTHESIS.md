# 04. Hypothesis: Formal Claims

## 4.1 Primary Hypothesis

### H1: Structural Equivalence

**Statement:** Simulation Theory and Maya Vidya describe the same ontological structure using different vocabularies.

**Formal Expression:**
```
Let S = Modern Simulation Framework
Let M = Vedic Maya Framework

H1: S ≅ M (isomorphic mapping exists)
```

**Testable Predictions:**
- Every core concept in S has a corresponding concept in M
- The functional relationships are preserved
- The explanatory power is equivalent

---

## 4.2 Secondary Hypotheses

### H2: Physics as Rendering

**Statement:** Observable physics phenomena that support simulation theory (quantum mechanics, Planck limits, observer effect) directly correspond to Maya's described rendering mechanisms.

**Formal Expression:**
```
Let P = {p1, p2, ... pn} = Physics phenomena supporting simulation
Let R = {r1, r2, ... rn} = Maya rendering mechanisms

H2: For each pi in P, there exists ri in R such that pi ~ ri
```

**Specific Mappings:**
| Physics (P) | Maya Rendering (R) |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Superposition | Unmanifest potential |
| Collapse | Drishti-srishti |
| Entanglement | Non-local akashic connection |
| Planck length | Maya's resolution |
| Light speed | Maya's bandwidth |

### H3: Consciousness Primacy

**Statement:** Unlike materialist simulation theory where consciousness is simulated, Maya theory correctly identifies consciousness as the substrate (simulator), not the simulated.

**Formal Expression:**
```
Materialist Simulation: Hardware --> Software --> Consciousness
Maya Framework: Consciousness --> Maya --> Appearance

H3: The second model has greater explanatory power for consciousness-related phenomena
```

**Supporting Evidence:**
- Hard problem of consciousness (no materialist solution)
- NDE/OBE phenomena
- Meditation experiences of non-local awareness

### H4: Exit Methodology

**Statement:** The documented methodology for "exiting" (Moksha) in Vedic literature provides a practical path that simulation theory lacks.

**Formal Expression:**
```
Let E_modern = Modern proposals for simulation exit
Let E_vedic = Moksha methodology

H4: E_vedic is more developed, testable, and documented than E_modern
```

## 4.3 Null Hypotheses

### H0-1: Random Correlation

**Statement:** The apparent correspondence between simulation theory and Maya is coincidental, resulting from both being attempts to explain the same experiences.

**Counter-Evidence Required:**
- Specific, detailed mappings beyond general analogy
- Predictive alignment (Maya predicts what simulation theory discovers)
- Functional equivalence in edge cases

### H0-2: Category Error

**Statement:** Simulation (computational) and Maya (metaphysical) operate in different categories and comparison is invalid.

**Counter-Argument:**
- Both make claims about reality's fundamental nature
- Both have observable implications
- Both propose consciousness-reality relationship
- Category distinction is itself an interpretation

## 4.4 Operational Definitions

For hypothesis testing, we define:

| Term | Operational Definition |
|------|----------------------|
| **Corresponding** | Concepts serve same function in their respective frameworks |
| **Rendering** | Process by which potential becomes perceived actuality |
| **Observer effect** | Measurement/perception changes system state |
| **Exit/Liberation** | Cessation of identification with simulated/rendered identity |
| **Substrate** | That upon which the simulation/rendering occurs |

## 4.5 Testability Criteria

### 4.5.1 Concept Mapping Test

**Criterion:** For H1 to pass, we must demonstrate:
- At least 10 core concepts map bidirectionally
- No fundamental concept in one lacks analog in other
- Mappings are not forced/artificial

### 4.5.2 Physics Correlation Test

**Criterion:** For H2 to pass:
- Quantum phenomena must align with drishti-srishti
- Physical limits must correspond to Maya's constraints
- Predictions must be consistent

### 4.5.3 Explanatory Power Test

**Criterion:** For H3 to pass:
- Maya framework must explain consciousness phenomena better
- No consciousness phenomenon should contradict framework
- Practical implications (meditation, etc.) must be consistent

### 4.5.4 Exit Documentation Test

**Criterion:** For H4 to pass:
- Vedic methodology must be more detailed than modern proposals
- Historical documentation of successful "exits" must exist
- Methodology must be reproducible (at least in principle)
