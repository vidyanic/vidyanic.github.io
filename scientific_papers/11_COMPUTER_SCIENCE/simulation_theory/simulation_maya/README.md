## Questions Answered

1. **Is reality a simulation?** -> Yes, Maya (rendering engine) projects reality
2. **Who runs the simulation?** -> Brahman through Maya — and YOU are Brahman
3. **Can we exit?** -> Yes, Moksha is the exit function
4. **Why does this matter?** -> Physics becomes code, spirituality becomes engineering

|   MODERN SIMULATION THEORY:                                         |
|   "We might be in a computer simulation run by advanced beings"     |
|                                                                     |
|   VEDIC MAYA THEORY (5,000+ years ago):                             |
|   "Reality is projected by Maya, the cosmic rendering engine.       |
|    You are both the simulation AND the simulator (Brahman)."        |

|   KEY DIFFERENCE:                                                   |
|   Modern: External simulator exists                                 |
|   Vedic: YOU ARE the simulator, temporarily playing as character    |
