# 01. Introduction: The Question of Reality's Nature

## 1.1 The Modern Question

In 2003, philosopher Nick Bostrom published "Are You Living in a Computer Simulation?" — a paper that would fundamentally reshape how technologists and scientists think about the nature of reality. His argument was deceptively simple:

**The Trilemma:**
1. Almost all civilizations go extinct before achieving the computational power to simulate consciousness
2. Almost all civilizations that achieve this power choose not to run "ancestor simulations"
3. We are almost certainly living in a computer simulation

If neither (1) nor (2) is true, then the sheer number of simulated beings would vastly outnumber "base reality" beings, making it statistically overwhelming that any randomly selected conscious being (like you) is simulated.

## 1.2 The Ancient Answer

Five thousand years before Bostrom, the Rig Veda declared:

> **"इन्द्रो मायाभिः पुरुरूप ईयते"**  
> "Indra through Maya assumes many forms."  
> — Rig Veda 6.47.18

This wasn't speculation. It was presented as direct knowledge: Reality (jagat) is the projection of Maya upon the screen of Brahman. What you perceive as a differentiated world of objects, beings, and events is a cosmic rendering — neither fully real nor fully unreal.

## 1.3 Why This Comparison Matters

+------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                                  |
|   QUESTION: Is reality a simulation?                             |
|                                                                  |
|   MODERN ANSWER: Probably. Someone else is running it.           |
|                                                                  |
|   VEDIC ANSWER: Definitely. And YOU are running it.              |
|                                                                  |
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The difference is profound:
- **Modern view:** We are helpless characters in someone else's program
- **Vedic view:** We are the programmer who forgot we're programming

## 1.4 The Computational Universe

Modern physics increasingly describes the universe in informational terms:

**John Wheeler (physicist):** "It from bit" — everything is information
**Max Tegmark:** The universe IS mathematics
**Seth Lloyd:** The universe is a quantum computer

These aren't metaphors. They're serious scientific proposals that reality is fundamentally computational.

## 1.5 The Evidence Landscape

| Observable | Simulation Interpretation |
|------------|--------------------------|
| Quantum superposition | Unrendered possibilities |
| Wave function collapse | Rendering upon observation |
| Speed of light | Bandwidth limit |
| Planck length | Minimum pixel size |
| Planck time | Minimum clock tick |
| Fine-tuned constants | Designed parameters |
| Quantum entanglement | Non-local memory access |

## 1.6 Scope of This Paper

This paper will:

1. **Review** both modern simulation theory and Vedic Maya concepts
2. **Map** the precise correspondences between them
3. **Analyze** where they diverge and why
4. **Examine** the physics evidence supporting both
5. **Explore** the implications for consciousness and liberation
6. **Validate** against the 7-concept stack
7. **Conclude** with a unified understanding

## 1.7 Key Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Simulation** | A computed model of reality |
| **Maya** | The cosmic rendering engine |
| **Brahman** | Undifferentiated consciousness (the substrate) |
| **Jagat** | The manifested world (the rendering) |
| **Jiva** | Individual experiencer (the avatar) |
| **Moksha** | Liberation from identification with avatar |
| **Lila** | Divine play (the purpose of simulation) |

## 1.8 The Core Question

This paper addresses one fundamental question:

**Is the modern discovery that "reality might be simulated" the same insight that Vedic seers documented millennia ago as "Maya"?**

Our hypothesis: **Yes, with one crucial refinement.**

Modern simulation theory asks: "Who is running the simulation?"  
Maya vidya answers: "You are. You just forgot."
