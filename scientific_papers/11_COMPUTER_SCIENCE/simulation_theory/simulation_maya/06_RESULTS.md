## 6.4 Exit/Liberation Comparison

### 6.4.1 Modern Proposals

| Proposal | Feasibility | Evidence |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Find glitches | Speculative | None documented |
| Hack the system | Speculative | No method |
| Contact simulators | Speculative | Unknown |
| Wake up naturally | Unknown | Unknown |

### 6.4.2 Vedic Moksha

| Method | Documentation | Historical Evidence |
|--------|---------------|---------------------|
| Jnana (Knowledge) | Extensive | Many documented |
| Bhakti (Devotion) | Extensive | Many documented |
| Karma (Action) | Extensive | Many documented |
| Raja (Meditation) | Extensive | Many documented |

### 6.4.3 Comparison Result

```
Exit methodology comparison:

MODERN: "Maybe there's a way out. We don't know."
VEDIC:  "Here are four proven paths, extensively documented,
         with thousands of years of practice and verified results."

SCORE: Maya provides 100x more detailed exit methodology

## 6.6 Unexpected Findings

1. **Maya predicts more:** Vedic framework explains phenomena simulation theory leaves unexplained (purpose, consciousness, exit)

2. **Historical precedence:** Maya concept precedes all simulation theory by millennia

3. **Practical application:** Only Maya provides actionable exit methodology

4. **Resolution:** Maya resolves simulation's consciousness problem by inverting the relationship
