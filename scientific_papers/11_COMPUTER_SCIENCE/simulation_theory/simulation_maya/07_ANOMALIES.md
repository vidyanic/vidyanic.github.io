# 07. Anomalies: Where the Frameworks Diverge

## 7.1 Identified Discrepancies

### 7.1.1 The Consciousness Question

**Simulation Theory:**
- Consciousness might be emergent from computation
- We might be "just" information processing
- Philosophical zombies possible
- Hard problem unresolved

**Maya Framework:**
- Consciousness is fundamental and primary
- Information emerges in consciousness
- Zombies impossible (all awareness is Brahman)
- Hard problem dissolved

**Resolution:**
Maya framework handles this better. Modern simulation theory inherits materialist confusion about consciousness.

### 7.1.2 The Purpose Question

**Simulation Theory:**
- Purpose unknown
- Maybe research, entertainment, or nothing
- Creates existential anxiety
- No meaning guaranteed

**Maya Framework:**
- Purpose is Lila (divine play)
- Brahman experiencing itself through forms
- Creates existential purpose
- Meaning is inherent

**Resolution:**
Maya provides purpose; simulation theory cannot.

## 7.2 Apparent Contradictions

### 7.2.1 Multiple Simulators vs. One Brahman

**Simulation Theory:**
- Could be multiple simulations
- Simulations within simulations
- Many simulators possible
- No unified source required

**Maya Framework:**
- One Brahman
- One Maya
- Apparent multiplicity within unity
- Single source

**Resolution:**
```
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                        RESOLVING MULTIPLICITY                    |
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                                  |
|  Maya accommodates this through levels of reality:               |
|                                                                  |
|  - Paramarthika: One Brahman (absolute level)                    |
|  - Vyavaharika: Apparent multiplicity (practical level)          |
|                                                                  |
|  Multiple simulations are possible at vyavaharika level          |
|  while maintaining non-dual Brahman at paramarthika level.       |
|                                                                  |
|  The "simulators" (Ishvaras) are themselves within Maya.         |
|  Only Brahman is truly "outside."                                |
|                                                                  |
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

### 7.2.2 Hardware vs. Consciousness Substrate

**Simulation Theory:**
- Requires physical hardware
- Computational substrate is material
- Could theoretically be turned off

**Maya Framework:**
- Substrate is consciousness
- No physical requirement
- Cannot be "turned off"

**Resolution:**
If consciousness is primary (H3), then what appears as "hardware" is itself rendered in consciousness. The simulation runs on consciousness, not silicon.

## 7.3 Anomalies Explained by Maya but Not Simulation

### 7.3.1 Consciousness Itself

**Anomaly:** Why does anything feel like something? (Qualia)

**Simulation Theory:** Cannot explain. Simulated consciousness might have no experience.

**Maya Framework:** Consciousness (Chit) is inherent in Brahman. Experience is not created but revealed.

### 7.3.2 Free Will

**Anomaly:** Do we have genuine agency or are we scripted?

**Simulation Theory:** Unclear. Might be deterministic computation.

**Maya Framework:** At vyavaharika level, relative free will operates. At paramarthika level, there's only Brahman willing.

### 7.3.3 Meaning and Value

**Anomaly:** Why does anything matter?

**Simulation Theory:** Possibly nothing matters. Nihilism risk.

**Maya Framework:** Everything matters AS the play of Brahman. Value is inherent in experience.

---

## 7.4 Anomalies Unexplained by Either

### 7.4.1 Why Anything at All?

**Question:** Why is there something rather than nothing?

**Simulation Theory:** Doesn't address. Assumes simulator exists.

**Maya Framework:** Brahman's nature is Sat-Chit-Ananda. Being and knowing are inseparable.

**Status:** Maya provides answer; simulation doesn't.

### 7.4.2 The Beginning Problem

**Question:** What started the simulation / When did Maya begin?

**Simulation Theory:** Simulator creates it at some point.

**Maya Framework:** Maya is beginningless (anadi). Brahman is eternal.

**Status:** Neither fully resolves; Maya at least addresses.

---

## 7.5 Physics Anomalies

### 7.5.1 Non-Locality

**Anomaly:** Entangled particles affect each other instantly across any distance.

**Simulation View:** Shared memory access.

**Maya View:** No true separation in Brahman. Locality is Maya's illusion.

**Status:** Both explain adequately.

### 7.5.2 Double-Slit Mystery

**Anomaly:** Why does observation change the result?

**Simulation View:** Lazy rendering optimization.

**Maya View:** Drishti-srishti — observation creates.

**Status:** Both explain; Maya is more elegant.

### 7.5.3 Fine-Tuning

**Anomaly:** Why are constants perfectly tuned for life?

**Simulation View:** Designed parameters.

**Maya View:** Ishvara configures Maya for experience.

**Status:** Both explain; Maya adds purpose.

## 7.6 Remaining Questions

### 7.6.1 For Simulation Theory

1. What is consciousness made of?
2. Who/what created the simulators?
3. Why would they simulate us?
4. How can we exit?
5. What determines the rules?

### 7.6.2 For Maya Framework

1. Why does Brahman project Maya?
2. Why does avidya (ignorance) arise?
3. Why do some beings achieve Moksha and others don't?
4. What happens after Moksha to the world?
5. How do different Jivas relate?

|  What's missing in Simulation Theory:                            |
|  1. Consciousness as primary (not emergent)                      |
|  2. Purpose for the simulation (Lila)                            |
|  3. Relationship between "player" and "character" (Atman/Jiva)   |
|  4. Detailed exit methodology (Moksha)                           |

|  Maya Theory = Simulation Theory + Consciousness + Purpose +     |
|                Exit + Meaning                                    |
