# 03. Theoretical Framework: Maya as Cosmic Rendering Engine

## 3.1 The Rendering Model

### 3.1.1 Computer Graphics Analogy

In computer graphics, a scene is rendered through:

```

|                   COMPUTER RENDERING PIPELINE                     |
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                                  |
|   DATA (Models, textures)                                        |
|          |                                                       |
|          v                                                       |
|   PROCESSING (Transform, calculate)                              |
|          |                                                       |
|          v                                                       |
|   RENDERING (Convert to pixels)                                  |
|          |                                                       |
|          v                                                       |
|   DISPLAY (Present to observer)                                  |
|                                                                  |
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The displayed image is not the "real" data — it's a projection suitable for human perception.

### 3.1.2 Maya as Rendering Engine

Vedic cosmology describes an identical structure:

|   BRAHMAN (Pure undifferentiated consciousness)                  |
|          |                                                       |
|          v through Maya                                          |
|   ISHVARA (Cosmic controller, sets parameters)                   |
|          |                                                       |
|          v creates                                               |
|   JAGAT (Manifested world, nama-rupa)                            |
|          |                                                       |
|          v experienced by                                        |
|   JIVA (Individual consciousness, avatar)                        |
|                                                                  |

## 3.2 Core Theoretical Concepts

### 3.2.1 Brahman (The Substrate)

**Definition:** Pure, undifferentiated consciousness — the "hardware" on which reality runs.

**Properties:**
- Sat (existence itself)
- Chit (consciousness itself)  
- Ananda (bliss itself)
- Without attributes (nirguna)
- Unchanging, eternal

**Computational Analog:** The fundamental computing substrate — not the simulation, but what the simulation runs on.

### 3.2.2 Maya (The Rendering Engine)

**Definition:** The power by which Brahman appears as differentiated world.

**Functions:**
- **Avarana** (Veiling): Hides true nature
- **Vikshepa** (Projection): Projects false appearances
- Creates space-time-causality
- Generates name and form (nama-rupa)

**Computational Analog:** The rendering engine, physics engine, and game rules combined.

### 3.2.3 Jagat (The Rendered World)

**Definition:** The manifested universe as experienced.

**Properties:**
- Neither fully real (sat) nor unreal (asat)
- Mithya (apparent reality)
- Dependent on Brahman for existence
- Subject to change, destruction

**Computational Analog:** The game world, the rendered scene, the VR environment.

### 3.2.4 Jiva (The Player/Avatar)

**Definition:** Individual consciousness experiencing the world.

**Two aspects:**
- **Atman:** True nature (identical to Brahman)
- **Ahamkara:** Ego-identification (the avatar identity)

**Computational Analog:** The player who has forgotten they're the player and thinks they're just the character.

## 3.3 The Rendering Mechanism

### 3.3.1 Drishti-Srishti (Observation-Creation)

**Principle:** The world is created in the act of perception.

```
Classical View:  World exists --> Observer perceives it
Drishti-Srishti: Observer perceives --> World appears
```

This is exactly what quantum mechanics suggests:
- Superposition until observation
- Wave function collapse upon measurement
- Reality rendered on demand

### 3.3.2 Levels of Reality (Satya Traya)

| Level | Name | Description | Analog |
|-------|------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Paramarthika | Absolute reality | Base reality |
| 2 | Vyavaharika | Practical reality | The simulation |
| 3 | Pratibhasika | Illusory reality | Dreams, errors |

A game character's world is real at vyavaharika level, but illusory from paramarthika (player's) perspective.

## 3.4 The Three Gunas as Rendering Parameters

### 3.4.1 Guna Framework

Maya renders through three qualities:

| Guna | Quality | Rendering Effect |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| **Sattva** | Clarity | Clean rendering, revelation |
| **Rajas** | Activity | Motion, change, dynamics |
| **Tamas** | Inertia | Obscuration, materialization |

### 3.4.2 Physics Mapping

| Guna | Physical Manifestation |
|------|----------------------|
| Sattva | Light, electromagnetic radiation |
| Rajas | Motion, kinetic energy |
| Tamas | Mass, gravity, entropy |

All phenomena are combinations of these three "rendering modes."

## 3.5 The Observer's Role

### 3.5.1 Consciousness as Primary

Unlike materialist simulation theory (consciousness emerges from computation), Maya theory holds:

```
MATERIALIST: Matter --> Computation --> Consciousness
VEDIC:       Consciousness --> Maya --> Appearance of matter
```

Consciousness is not simulated — consciousness IS the simulator.

### 3.5.2 Why Things Appear

The rendering occurs because:
1. **Brahman's nature** is to know/experience
2. **Maya enables** apparent differentiation
3. **Experience requires** subject-object split (apparent only)
4. **Lila** (play) is the purpose

---

## 3.6 The Exit Function (Moksha)

### 3.6.1 Not Escape, Recognition

Moksha is not escaping the simulation but recognizing:
- You are not the avatar
- You are the player
- The player IS Brahman
- There's nowhere to escape TO

### 3.6.2 Mechanics of Liberation

```
Ignorance (Avidya):
    "I am the body-mind (avatar)"
          |
          v through knowledge
Discrimination (Viveka):
    "I am the witness of body-mind"
          |
          v through realization  
Liberation (Moksha):
    "I am Brahman playing as this"
```

## 3.7 Theoretical Predictions

If this framework is correct:

1. **Reality should behave computationally** — It does (quantum)
2. **Observation should affect reality** — It does (collapse)
3. **There should be resolution limits** — There are (Planck)
4. **There should be bandwidth limits** — There are (light speed)
5. **Constants should appear "designed"** — They do (fine-tuning)
6. **Exit should be possible through recognition** — Documented (Moksha)
