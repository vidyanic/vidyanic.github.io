# Abstract: Simulation Theory = Maya Vidya

## Core Thesis

This paper establishes a rigorous correspondence between modern Simulation Theory and the Vedic concept of Maya (माया), demonstrating that the hypothesis "reality may be a computer simulation" is the contemporary rediscovery of an insight documented in Vedic literature for over 5,000 years.

## Background

**Modern Context:**
Nick Bostrom's 2003 Simulation Argument proposed that at least one of three statements must be true:
1. Civilizations go extinct before achieving simulation capability
2. Advanced civilizations choose not to run ancestor simulations
3. We are almost certainly living in a simulation

This argument has gained serious attention from physicists (Neil deGrasse Tyson estimates 50-50 odds), technologists (Elon Musk), and philosophers worldwide.

**Vedic Context:**
Maya (माया), described in Rig Veda, Upanishads, and Advaita Vedanta, is the cosmic "rendering engine" that projects the appearance of a differentiated world upon the substrate of undifferentiated Brahman (pure consciousness). The world is neither fully real (sat) nor fully unreal (asat) — it is mithya (apparent reality).

## Hypothesis

**H1:** Simulation Theory and Maya Theory describe the same ontological structure from different cultural and temporal perspectives.

**H2:** The features that make reality appear "computational" (quantum mechanics, Planck limits, observer effect) directly correspond to Maya's rendering mechanisms described in Vedic texts.

**H3:** The key difference is axiological: Modern simulation implies an external creator; Maya reveals the experiencer IS the creator (Brahman).

## Methodology

1. **Comparative Analysis:** Map simulation concepts to Maya concepts
2. **Physics Correlation:** Show how quantum phenomena align with rendering
3. **Philosophical Integration:** Resolve the "who runs it?" question
4. **Validation:** Apply 7-concept stack verification

## Key Findings

| Modern Concept | Vedic Equivalent | Correspondence |
|----------------|------------------|----------------|
| Simulation | Maya | 95% |
| Code/Laws | Dharma | 90% |
| Simulator | Brahman/Ishvara | 85% |
| User/Avatar | Jiva/Atman | 90% |
| Exit/Logout | Moksha | 95% |
| Processing limits | Planck scale | 80% |
| Rendering on observation | Drishti-Srishti | 90% |

## Implications

1. **For Physics:** Reality's computational nature becomes a design feature, not a mystery
2. **For Philosophy:** Mind-body problem dissolves (consciousness is primary, not emergent)
3. **For Spirituality:** Ancient wisdom receives scientific scaffolding
4. **For Practice:** "Exiting the simulation" (Moksha) has a documented methodology
