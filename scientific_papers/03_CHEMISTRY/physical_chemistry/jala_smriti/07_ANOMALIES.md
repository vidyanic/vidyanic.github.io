## 7.1 Replication Problem

### 7.1.1 The Issue

Benveniste and similar experiments:
- Some labs replicate
- Others consistently fail
- Same protocol, different results
- What's the hidden variable?

### 7.1.2 Possible Explanations

1. **Subtle contamination**
2. **Procedural variations**
3. **Experimenter effect** (consciousness?)
4. **Random statistical fluctuation**

## 7.2 Avogadro's Limit

### 7.2.1 The Chemistry Problem

Beyond ~12C dilution:
- No original molecules remain
- Only water molecules
- How can effect persist?
- Violates basic chemistry

### 7.2.2 Responses

- Information is in structure, not molecules
- Coherent domains store pattern
- EM signature persists
- Standard chemistry incomplete

---

## 7.3 Short Lifetimes

### 7.3.1 The Physics Problem

Hydrogen bonds:
- Lifetime: ~1 picosecond
- Constantly breaking and reforming
- How can memory persist?

### 7.3.2 Possible Resolution

- Collective effects
- Coherent domains have longer lifetimes
- Nanostructures more stable
- Not individual bonds but patterns

---

## 7.4 Experimenter Effect

### 7.4.1 The Observation

Some experiments show:
- Results correlate with experimenter belief
- Same setup, different outcomes
- Suggests consciousness factor

### 7.4.2 Interpretations

**Skeptic:** Wishful thinking, confirmation bias
**Believer:** Observer effect applies
**Vedic:** Sankalpa (intention) matters
