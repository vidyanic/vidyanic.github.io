# 3. Theoretical Framework

## 3.1 Proposed Mechanisms

### 3.1.1 Epitaxy (Template Effect)

```
EPITAXY MODEL:
==============

Solute molecule → Creates structural template
Water molecules → Organize around template
Template removed → Structure persists
Result → "Imprint" in water
```

### 3.1.2 Nanostructures

Nanobubbles may:
- Form during dilution
- Carry surface information
- Persist for extended periods
- Transfer effects to new water

### 3.1.3 Coherent Domains

del Giudice model:
- Water molecules in coherent quantum state
- Can store information patterns
- Similar to laser coherence
- Size: ~100 nm

### 3.1.4 Electromagnetic Imprinting

Montagnier model:
- Substances emit EM signatures
- Water records EM pattern
- Pattern can be detected and transferred
- Similar to holographic storage

## 3.2 Vedic Framework

### 3.2.1 Jala as Information Carrier

```
JALA TATTVA PROPERTIES:
=======================

Element: Jala (जल)
Quality: Rasa (रस) = Essence/Taste
Tanmatra: Rasa (taste sensation)
Function: Binding, cohesion, carrying

KEY INSIGHT:
Rasa literally means "essence" - the quality
that water carries and transmits.
```

### 3.2.2 Tejas in Jala

Some Vedic texts describe:
- Fire (Tejas) present within water
- Explains water's special properties
- May correspond to coherent domains
- Energy storage in water structure

## 3.3 Correspondence Table

| Proposed Mechanism | Vedic Equivalent |
|-------------------|------------------|
| Structural template | Rasa imprint |
| Coherent domains | Tejas in Jala |
| EM patterns | Shabda (sound) storage |
| Information transfer | Essence transmission |
