## 5.1 Research Approach

```
MULTI-LEVEL ANALYSIS:
=====================

1. PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY
   - Spectroscopic analysis
   - NMR studies
   - Structural measurement

2. BIOLOGICAL TESTING
   - Cell response studies
   - Organism effects
   - Homeopathy trials

3. VEDIC CORRELATION
   - Traditional text analysis
   - Practice documentation
   - Modern validation attempts
```

## 5.2 Data Sources

| Domain | Sources |
|--------|---------|
| Chemistry | Spectroscopy data, structural studies |
| Biology | Clinical trials, cell studies |
| Physics | EM measurements, coherence studies |
| Traditional | Ayurvedic texts, preparation protocols |

## 5.3 Evidence Classification

```
EVIDENCE TIERS:
===============

TIER 1 (Strong):
- Replicated in multiple labs
- Mechanism understood
- Published in major journals

TIER 2 (Moderate):
- Some replications
- Mechanism proposed
- Published but disputed

TIER 3 (Weak):
- Single studies
- No clear mechanism
- Not well replicated
```

## 5.4 Validation Framework

7-Concept validation applied:
1. Conservation — Information conserved?
2. Entropy — Structure stability?
3. Fractal — Pattern at scales?
4. Karma — Input-output correlation?
5. Observer — Intention effect?
6. Cycles — Patterns cyclic?
7. Gunas — Water states classifiable?
