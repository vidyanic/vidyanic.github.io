# 2. Literature Review

---

## 2.1 Benveniste Research (1988)

### 2.1.1 Original Study

Jacques Benveniste published in Nature:
- Antibody solution diluted beyond Avogadro limit
- No molecules should remain
- Yet triggered biological response in basophils
- Suggested water "remembered" the antibody

### 2.1.2 Aftermath

- Nature sent investigation team
- Results disputed, paper marked
- Benveniste lost funding
- Some replications succeeded, many failed

## 2.2 Montagnier Research (2009-2010)

### 2.2.1 Nobel Laureate Study

Luc Montagnier (Nobel Prize for HIV discovery):
- DNA dissolved in water
- Extremely diluted
- Electromagnetic signals detected from dilution
- Signals transferred to pure water
- That water synthesized original DNA!

### 2.2.2 Status

- Published in legitimate journal
- Replications attempted
- Very controversial
- Research ongoing in China

## 2.3 Gerald Pollack - EZ Water

### 2.3.1 Fourth Phase

University of Washington research:
- "Exclusion Zone" water near hydrophilic surfaces
- Different properties than bulk water
- More structured, gel-like
- May explain biological water behavior

### 2.3.2 Implications

- Water has more structure than thought
- Biological water is different
- May support memory claims

## 2.4 Emoto's Crystal Photography

### 2.4.1 Claims

Masaru Emoto:
- Water exposed to words, music, thoughts
- Frozen to form crystals
- "Positive" produces beautiful crystals
- "Negative" produces irregular crystals

### 2.4.2 Scientific Status

- Not properly controlled
- Selection bias likely
- Not peer-reviewed adequately
- Popular but not scientific evidence

---

## 2.5 Coherent Domains (del Giudice)

### 2.5.1 Quantum Electrodynamics Model

Emilio del Giudice proposed:
- Water has coherent domains
- ~100 nm regions
- Quantum coherent behavior
- Could store information

### 2.5.2 Status

- Theoretical model
- Some experimental support
- Not mainstream accepted

---

## 2.6 Vedic Sources

### 2.6.1 Charaka Samhita

Traditional preparations:
- Kashaya (decoctions)
- Phanta (hot infusions)
- Sheeta (cold infusions)
- Potency often exceeds dissolved content

### 2.6.2 Tirtha Traditions

Holy waters believed to:
- Carry spiritual essence
- Purify consumers
- Transfer blessings
- Maintain potency over time
