## 10.2 7-Concept Validation Stack

### 10.2.1 Conservation

```
TEST: Is information conserved in water?
EVIDENCE: Unknown - cannot measure "information" in water directly
STATUS: UNTESTABLE with current methods
SCORE: N/A
```

### 10.2.2 Entropy

```
TEST: Does water structure follow thermodynamics?
EVIDENCE: Hydrogen bonds rapidly reform
STATUS: Standard thermodynamics applies
SCORE: ✅ PASSES
```

### 10.2.3 Fractal

```
TEST: Same patterns at different scales?
EVIDENCE: Clusters → Domains → Bulk water
STATUS: Some fractal structure observed
SCORE: ✅ PARTIAL
```

### 10.2.4 Karma

```
TEST: Does input determine output?
EVIDENCE: Preparation method → Water properties
STATUS: Some correlation claimed
SCORE: ⚠️ DISPUTED
```

### 10.2.5 Observer

```
TEST: Does observation/intention affect water?
EVIDENCE: Experimenter effects noted
STATUS: Controversial
SCORE: ⚠️ POSSIBLE
```

### 10.2.6 Cycles

```
TEST: Are there cyclic patterns?
EVIDENCE: Unknown
STATUS: Not specifically tested
SCORE: N/A
```

### 10.2.7 Gunas

```
TEST: Can water states be classified S/R/T?
EVIDENCE:
- Sattva = Pure, structured, coherent
- Rajas = Active, flowing, mixing
- Tamas = Stagnant, polluted, disordered
STATUS: Framework fits
SCORE: ✅ APPLIES
```
