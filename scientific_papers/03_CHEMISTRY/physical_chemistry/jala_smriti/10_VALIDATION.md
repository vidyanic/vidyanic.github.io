## 10.4 Logical Validation

```
LOGICAL CHAIN:
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Premise 1: Water has 70+ anomalous properties vs typical liquids
           — Source: Chaplin M., "Water Anomalies" (documented)
Premise 2: Water forms hydrogen-bond networks and domains
           — Source: X-ray/neutron scattering, IR spectroscopy
Premise 3: Vedic texts call water "Jala" with memory of origins
           — Source: Vedic cosmology (Jala from Tejas, retains essence)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Conclusion: Water has unusual structural properties that MAY encode
            information — hypothesis partially supported, not proven
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Validity: PARTIAL (Strong anomaly evidence, weak memory evidence)
```
