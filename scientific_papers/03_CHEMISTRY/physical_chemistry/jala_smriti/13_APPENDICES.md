## Appendix A: Water Anomalies Summary

### A.1 Physical Properties

| Property | Water Value | Typical Liquid | Anomaly |
|----------|-------------|----------------|---------|
| Max density | 4°C | 0°C (freezing) | Ice floats |
| Heat capacity | 4.18 J/g·K | ~1-2 | Highest |
| Surface tension | 72.8 mN/m | ~20-40 | Very high |
| Thermal conductivity | 0.6 W/m·K | Varies | High |
| Dielectric constant | 80 | ~2-10 | Very high |

### A.2 Explanation

These anomalies arise from:
- Strong hydrogen bonding
- Tetrahedral structure
- Network formation

## Appendix B: Homeopathic Potencies

### B.1 Dilution Scale

| Potency | Dilution | Molecules Remaining |
|---------|----------|---------------------|
| 1X | 1:10 | Yes |
| 6X | 1:10⁶ | Yes |
| 12X = 6C | 1:10¹² | Possibly |
| 12C | 1:10²⁴ | Avogadro limit |
| 30C | 1:10⁶⁰ | None |
| 200C | 1:10⁴⁰⁰ | None |

### B.2 Avogadro's Number

N_A = 6.022 × 10²³

Beyond 12C (10²⁴ dilution), statistically no original molecules remain.

## Appendix C: Vedic Water Classification

### C.1 Types of Water (Charaka Samhita)

| Type | Source | Properties |
|------|--------|------------|
| Gangambu | Rain from clouds | Pure, light, best |
| Samudriya | Sea water | Heavy, cleansing |
| Sarasiya | Lake water | Depends on lake |
| Nadeya | River water | Moving, energized |
| Kupa | Well water | Heavier |

### C.2 Water for Medicine

Different preparations require different waters:
- Pure water for internal
- Various waters for external
- Specific waters for specific conditions

## Appendix D: EZ Water Properties

### D.1 Exclusion Zone Characteristics

Gerald Pollack's findings:
- Forms near hydrophilic surfaces
- Excludes solutes (hence "exclusion zone")
- More structured than bulk water
- Negative charge
- Different properties
- May be biological water's natural state

## Appendix E: Traditional Water Practices

### E.1 Cross-Cultural

| Tradition | Practice | Mechanism Proposed |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Hindu | Tirtha (holy water) | Blessing stored |
| Christian | Holy water | Prayer charge |
| Japanese | Emoto crystals | Intention |
| Ayurveda | Copper vessel | Ion structuring |
| Chinese | Feng Shui water | Energy flow |

### E.2 Common Elements

All traditions suggest:
1. Water can be "charged"
2. Charge affects consumers
3. Intention matters
4. Container matters
5. Source matters
