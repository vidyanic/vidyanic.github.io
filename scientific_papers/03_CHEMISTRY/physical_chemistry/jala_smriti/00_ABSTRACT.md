## Research Question

Can water retain and transmit information through structural memory, validating the Vedic understanding of Jala (जल) as an essence carrier?

---

## Hypothesis

**H₁:** Water possesses the capacity to retain structural information through cluster formations, coherent domains, or electromagnetic patterns, corresponding to the Vedic concept of Jala carrying Rasa (essence).
