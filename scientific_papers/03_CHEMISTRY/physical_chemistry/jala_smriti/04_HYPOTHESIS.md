# 4. Hypothesis

---

## 4.1 Primary Hypothesis

**H₁:** Water possesses structural memory capacity through cluster formations, coherent domains, or electromagnetic patterns, enabling information storage and transmission.

---

## 4.2 Sub-Hypotheses

### H₂: Structural Persistence
Water cluster structures can persist beyond expected ~picosecond lifetimes under certain conditions.
**Status:** Some evidence.

### H₃: Information Transfer
Information encoded in water can be transmitted to new water samples.
**Status:** Montagnier claims this; disputed.

### H₄: Biological Activity
Structured water can produce biological effects beyond chemical composition.
**Status:** Homeopathy debate; inconclusive.

### H₅: Consciousness Response
Water structure responds to consciousness/intention.
**Status:** Emoto-type claims; not scientifically established.

## 4.3 Predictions

| If True | Observable |
|---------|------------|
| Structure persists | Measurable patterns after dilution |
| Information transfers | Reproducible signal transmission |
| Biological effects | Consistent physiological response |
| Vedic validated | Traditional preparations work beyond placebo |

---

## 4.4 Falsification

Hypothesis weakened if:
1. No structural persistence measurable
2. All effects explained by contamination
3. Consistent replication impossible
4. Mechanism remains entirely unknown
