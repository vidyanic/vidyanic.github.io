## Research Question

Can elemental transmutation, long dismissed as alchemical fantasy, be validated by modern nuclear physics and Vedic Rasayana science?

---

## Hypothesis

**H₁:** Alchemical transmutation represents an intuitive understanding of nuclear transformation processes, validated by modern physics and supported by the Vedic framework of Rasayana Vidya (transformation science).

## Key Findings

| Classical Alchemy | Modern Physics | Vedic Rasayana |
|-------------------|----------------|----------------|
| Lead to gold | Nuclear transmutation | Parada transformation |
| Philosopher's Stone | Catalyst | Mani (gem catalyst) |
| Elixir of Life | Cellular rejuvenation | Rasayana (rejuvenation) |
| Spiritual transformation | Consciousness shift | Moksha through purification |
