## 5.2 Data Sources

### 5.2.1 Scientific Data

| Source | Data Type |
|--------|-----------|
| Nuclear physics journals | Transmutation mechanics |
| LENR research database | Experimental results |
| Biological transmutation literature | Anomalous observations |
| Spectroscopic analysis | Elemental composition |

### 5.2.2 Traditional Sources

| Text | Content |
|------|---------|
| Rasa-Ratna-Samucchaya | Mercury processing |
| Charaka Samhita | Rasayana chapter |
| Siddha pharmacopoeia | Traditional preparations |
| Nagarjuna's works | Alchemical procedures |

## 5.3 Analysis Methods

### 5.3.1 Evidence Evaluation

```
EVIDENCE CLASSIFICATION:
========================

TIER 1 (Strong):
- Peer-reviewed, replicated
- Multiple independent confirmations
- Clear mechanism understood

TIER 2 (Moderate):
- Published but controversial
- Some replications
- Mechanism disputed

TIER 3 (Weak):
- Anecdotal/historical
- No replications
- Mechanism unknown

Each claim categorized by tier.
```

### 5.3.2 Correspondence Mapping

| Alchemical Concept | Modern Equivalent | Confidence |
|-------------------|-------------------|------------|
| Transmutation | Nuclear reaction | 100% |
| Philosopher's Stone | Catalyst | 80% |
| Prima Materia | Quantum vacuum | 60% |
| Spiritual gold | Enlightenment | N/A (different domain) |

---

## 5.4 Validation Framework

### 5.4.1 7-Concept Stack Applied

| Concept | Test |
|---------|------|
| Conservation | Energy/mass preserved in transmutation? |
| Entropy | Transformation follows thermodynamics? |
| Fractal | Pattern at atomic → cosmic scales? |
| Karma | Cause → effect chain? |
| Observer | Consciousness role? |
| Cycles | Transformation cycles? |
| Gunas | S/R/T in matter states? |

## 5.5 Limitations

1. **Historical records unreliable** — Exaggeration common
2. **LENR data controversial** — Replication issues
3. **Biological transmutation disputed** — Methodological concerns
4. **Consciousness role hard to measure** — No standard protocol
