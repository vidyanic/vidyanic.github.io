## 10.2 Concept 1: Conservation

### Test
Is energy conserved in transmutation?

### Analysis
- E = mc² governs nuclear transmutation
- Mass converts to energy and back
- Total mass-energy conserved
- Nothing created or destroyed

### Validation

```
CONSERVATION CHECK:
-------------------
Mass-energy equivalence                       [PASS]
Nuclear reactions conserve mass-energy        [PASS]
Information preserved in transformation       [PASS]

STATUS: VALIDATED
```

---

## 10.3 Concept 2: Entropy

### Test
How does entropy relate to transmutation?

### Analysis
- Fusion (combining light) releases energy, increases cosmic entropy
- Fission (splitting heavy) also increases entropy
- Transmutation requires energy input
- Transformation has entropic cost

### Validation

```
ENTROPY CHECK:
--------------
Transmutation requires energy                 [PASS]
Direction toward equilibrium                  [PASS]
dS/dt >= 0 maintained                         [PASS]

STATUS: VALIDATED
```

---

## 10.4 Concept 3: Fractal

### Test
Is transformation self-similar at different scales?

### Analysis
- Atomic transmutation (nuclear)
- Chemical transformation (reactions)
- Biological transformation (metabolism)
- Psychological transformation (growth)
- Spiritual transformation (Moksha)
- Same principle at all levels

### Validation

```
FRACTAL CHECK:
--------------
Transformation at atomic level               [PASS]
Transformation at biological level           [PASS]
Transformation at psychological level        [PASS]
Same principle, different scales             [PASS]

STATUS: VALIDATED
```

---

## 10.5 Concept 4: Karma

### Test
Do alchemical actions have consequences?

### Analysis
- Procedures lead to results
- Wrong process leads to failure
- Right process leads to transformation
- Cause-effect in all chemistry

### Validation

```
KARMA CHECK:
------------
Process determines outcome                   [PASS]
Actions have chemical consequences           [PASS]
Right method leads to right result           [PASS]

STATUS: VALIDATED
```

---

## 10.6 Concept 5: Observer

### Test
Does observation affect alchemical processes?

### Analysis
- Quantum level: Observation affects outcomes
- Biological level: Experimenter effects documented
- Consciousness role: Controversial but claimed
- Intention may affect results (Vedic claim)

### Validation

```
OBSERVER CHECK:
---------------
Quantum observation affects matter           [PASS]
Experimenter effects in chemistry            [PASS]
Consciousness role claimed                   [PARTIAL]

STATUS: VALIDATED (with caveats)
```

---

## 10.7 Concept 6: Cycles

### Test
Are there cycles in alchemy/transmutation?

### Analysis
- Elements cycle (carbon cycle, nitrogen cycle)
- Stellar nucleosynthesis cycles elements through universe
- Biological cycling of elements
- Death-rebirth of forms

### Validation

```
CYCLES CHECK:
-------------
Elements cycle through cosmos                [PASS]
Biological cycling documented                [PASS]
Transformation is cyclic                     [PASS]

STATUS: VALIDATED
```

---

## 10.8 Concept 7: Gunas

### Test
Can alchemical stages be classified by Gunas?

### Analysis
- **Tamas (Nigredo):** Black, decay, dissolution
- **Rajas (Albedo/Citrinitas):** Purification, transformation
- **Sattva (Rubedo):** Perfection, gold, illumination

The three stages of alchemy = Three Gunas!

### Validation

```
GUNAS CHECK:
------------
Nigredo = Tamas (dissolution)                [PASS]
Albedo = Rajas (transformation)              [PASS]
Rubedo = Sattva (perfection)                 [PASS]
S + R + T maps to alchemical stages          [PASS]

STATUS: VALIDATED
```

Premise 3: Vedic Rasayana describes similar transformation principles
           — Source: Charaka Samhita, Rasa Shastra texts
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Conclusion: Alchemy = Rasayana Vidya — both describe Guna-based
