|   CLASSICAL VIEW (Pre-Nuclear):                                     |
|   - Elements are fundamental, unchangeable                          |
|   - Transmutation is impossible                                     |
|   - Alchemy is superstition                                         |
|                                                                     |
|   MODERN PHYSICS (Validated):                                       |
|   - Nuclear reactions change elements                               |
|   - Transmutation happens in stars                                  |
|   - LENR shows low-energy transmutation possible                    |
|   - Biological transmutation documented (controversial)             |
|                                                                     |
|   VEDIC RASAYANA:                                                   |
|   - Transformation is fundamental to reality                        |
|   - Matter follows consciousness                                    |
|   - Purification leads to perfection                                |
|   - Physical alchemy mirrors spiritual alchemy                      |
|                                                                     |
|   SYNTHESIS:                                                        |
|   Alchemy was the intuition of a truth physics later proved.        |
|   All matter IS transformable. The method is the question.          |
|                                                                     |
