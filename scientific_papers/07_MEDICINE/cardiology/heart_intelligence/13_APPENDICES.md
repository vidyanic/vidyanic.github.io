## APPENDIX A: HEART COHERENCE TRAINING PROTOCOL

### A.1 Basic Technique

```
QUICK COHERENCE TECHNIQUE (HeartMath):
======================================

STEP 1: HEART FOCUS (30 seconds)
• Focus attention on heart area
• Imagine breathing through heart
• Slow your breathing

STEP 2: HEART BREATHING (1-2 minutes)
• Breathe slowly and deeply
• Inhale 5 seconds through heart
• Exhale 5 seconds through heart
• Maintain heart focus

STEP 3: HEART FEELING (1-2 minutes)
• Recall a positive feeling:
  - Appreciation
  - Care
  - Love for someone
• Experience the feeling
• Keep breathing slowly

DURATION: 3-5 minutes
FREQUENCY: 2-3 times daily, or when stressed
```

### A.2 Advanced Practice

```
HEART LOCK-IN TECHNIQUE:
=========================

1. Focus on heart
2. Breathe positive feeling for 5+ minutes
3. "Lock in" the feeling
4. Extend throughout day
5. Return when coherence drops

DURATION: 10-15 minutes
FREQUENCY: Once daily
```

## APPENDIX B: MEASURING COHERENCE

### B.1 HRV Measurement

| Parameter | Coherent | Incoherent |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| Peak at 0.1 Hz | High | Low/absent |
| Pattern | Sine-wave-like | Erratic |
| Regularity | High | Low |
| LF/HF ratio | ~1 | Variable |

### B.2 Visual Patterns

```
COHERENT HRV:
∿∿∿∿∿∿∿∿∿∿∿∿∿∿∿∿
Smooth, regular waves

INCOHERENT HRV:
/\/\-/\∿\/-/\/\-
Irregular, jagged pattern
```

## APPENDIX C: HEART NEURONS

### C.1 Types of Cardiac Neurons

| Type | Function |
|------|----------|
| **Sensory** | Detect heart state |
| **Interneurons** | Process information |
| **Motor** | Control heart function |
| **Memory** | Store patterns |

### C.2 Intrinsic Cardiac Ganglia

```
LOCATION: Surface of heart
NUMBER: ~40,000 neurons
ORGANIZATION: Clustered in ganglia
FUNCTION: Independent regulation + processing
COMMUNICATION: With brain and body
```

## APPENDIX D: ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD

### D.1 Field Characteristics

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Strength | ~60x brain |
| Shape | Toroidal |
| Reach | Several feet |
| Frequency | ~0.1 Hz dominant |
| Information | Emotionally encoded |

Field extends outward in all directions
Strongest at heart, weakens with distance

## APPENDIX F: BACKEND TEXTS

### F.1 Key Verses

**Chandogya Upanishad 8.1.1-3:**
```
"In this city of Brahman (body), there is a small lotus-dwelling (heart).
Within it is a small space (dahara akasha).
What is within that should be sought and known.

That space within the heart is as great as this external space.
Within it are contained heaven and earth,
Fire and wind, sun and moon, lightning and stars,
Whatever is and whatever is not — all that is contained within it."
```

**Bhagavad Gita 15.15:**
```
"I am seated in the hearts of all beings.
From Me come memory, knowledge, and their loss.
By all the Vedas am I to be known;
I am the author of Vedanta and the knower of the Vedas."
```

**Katha Upanishad 2.20:**
```
"Smaller than the smallest, greater than the greatest,
The Self is set in the heart of every creature.
The unstriving man beholds Him, freed from sorrow.
Through tranquility of mind and senses he sees the greatness of the Self."
```

## APPENDIX H: RESEARCH PROTOCOLS

### H.1 Coherence Training Study Design

```
PROPOSED STUDY:
===============

Objective: Test coherence training effects on cognition

Method:
1. Pre-test: Measure HRV, cognitive tests
2. Training: 4 weeks coherence practice
3. Post-test: Repeat measurements
4. Control: No training group

Measures:
• HRV coherence index
• Reaction time
• Memory tests
• Decision-making tasks
• Self-reported well-being

Expected: Training group shows improvement
```

### H.2 Heart-Brain Timing Study

```
PROPOSED STUDY:
===============

Objective: Confirm heart precedes brain in response

Method:
1. Present emotional stimuli
2. Simultaneously measure heart and brain
3. Compare timing of responses

Measures:
• ECG timing
• EEG timing
• Latency comparison

Expected: Heart response precedes brain
```
