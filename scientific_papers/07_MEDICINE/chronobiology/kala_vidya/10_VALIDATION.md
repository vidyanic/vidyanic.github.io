## 10.2 Concept 1: Conservation

### Test
Is information preserved in circadian systems?

### Analysis
- Genetic clock information conserved across evolution
- Same clock genes in flies, mice, humans
- Circadian information encoded in DNA
- Rhythms persist even in isolation

### Validation

```
CONSERVATION CHECK:
-------------------
Clock genes conserved evolutionarily         [PASS]
Information encoded in genome                [PASS]
Rhythms persist without external cues        [PASS]

STATUS: VALIDATED
```

---

## 10.3 Concept 2: Entropy

### Test
How do circadian rhythms relate to entropy?

### Analysis
- Rhythms create temporal order (low entropy)
- Energy required to maintain oscillation
- Synchronized systems more organized
- Disruption leads to disease (entropy increase)

### Validation

```
ENTROPY CHECK:
--------------
Rhythms create order                         [PASS]
Energy input required                        [PASS]
Disruption causes disorder                   [PASS]

STATUS: VALIDATED
```

---

## 10.4 Concept 3: Fractal

### Test
Are time rhythms self-similar at different scales?

### Analysis
- Ultradian (hours): Hormone pulses
- Circadian (24h): Daily cycles
- Infradian (months): Menstrual, seasonal
- Annual: Seasonal rhythms
- Same oscillator principles at all scales

### Validation

```
FRACTAL CHECK:
--------------
Rhythms at multiple time scales              [PASS]
Same principles apply                        [PASS]
Nested cycles (days within years)            [PASS]

STATUS: VALIDATED (This IS the core topic)
```

---

## 10.5 Concept 4: Karma

### Test
Do timing choices cause health effects?

### Analysis
- Shift work -> Cancer, metabolic disease
- Sleep deprivation -> Cognitive impairment
- Proper timing -> Health optimization
- Actions at wrong times have consequences

### Validation

```
KARMA CHECK:
------------
Timing affects outcomes                      [PASS]
Disruption causes disease                    [PASS]
Proper rhythm promotes health                [PASS]

STATUS: VALIDATED
```

---

## 10.6 Concept 5: Observer

### Test
Does observation affect circadian rhythms?

### Analysis
- Light observation by retina resets clock
- Awareness of time affects behavior
- Social cues (observation of others) entrain rhythms
- Subjective time perception varies with state

### Validation

```
OBSERVER CHECK:
---------------
Light perception resets clock               [PASS]
Awareness affects timing behavior           [PASS]
Social observation entrains                 [PASS]

STATUS: VALIDATED
```

---

## 10.7 Concept 6: Cycles

### Test
Are circadian rhythms cyclic?

### Analysis
This IS the core topic — cycles in biology:
- f(t+24h) = f(t) for circadian
- Predictable, periodic, reliable
- Repeat indefinitely

### Validation

```
CYCLES CHECK:
-------------
24-hour cycles documented                   [PASS]
f(t+T) = f(t) for all biological rhythms   [PASS]
Periodicity is fundamental                  [PASS]

STATUS: VALIDATED (This IS the core topic)
```

---

## 10.8 Concept 7: Gunas

### Test
Can time periods be classified by Gunas?

### Analysis
- **Brahma Muhurta (pre-dawn):** Sattva dominant — clarity, meditation
- **Day hours:** Rajas dominant — activity, work
- **Night hours:** Tamas dominant — rest, sleep
- Vedic timing based on Guna optimization

### Validation

```
GUNAS CHECK:
------------
Time periods classifiable                   [PASS]
Sattva (dawn), Rajas (day), Tamas (night)  [PASS]
S + R + T = 1 throughout cycle              [PASS]

STATUS: VALIDATED
```
