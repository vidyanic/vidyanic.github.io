# 4. Hypothesis

## 4.1 Primary Hypothesis

**H₁:** Biological rhythms represent the implementation of cosmic time cycles in living systems, validating Vedic Kala Vidya as accurate time science.

---

## 4.2 Sub-Hypotheses

### H₂: Clock Genes as Kala Implementation
Clock genes are the genetic implementation of Kala (time) principle.
**Status:** Strongly supported.

### H₃: Sandhya Times Are Biologically Significant
Dawn and dusk are genuine physiological transition points, not arbitrary ritual times.
**Status:** Well-supported (cortisol awakening, melatonin onset).

### H₄: Brahma Muhurta Is Optimal
Pre-dawn practice time has neurobiological basis.
**Status:** Supported (low cortisol, high theta, transition state).

### H₅: Lunar Rhythms Are Real
Lunar cycles affect biology.
**Status:** Some evidence (menstrual, sleep), mixed.

## 4.3 Predictions

| If True | Observable |
|---------|------------|
| Clocks as Kala | Universal in all life (✅ proven) |
| Sandhya significance | Hormone transitions at dawn/dusk (✅ proven) |
| Brahma Muhurta | Distinct neurophysiology pre-dawn (✅ supported) |
| Lunar effects | Correlations with moon phase (⚠️ mixed) |

---

## 4.4 Falsification

Hypothesis weakened if:
1. Circadian rhythms purely arbitrary
2. No biological significance to dawn/dusk
3. Traditional timing practices ineffective
4. No cosmic-biological synchronization
