## 8.1 Time as System Parameter

### 8.1.1 Simulation Model

```
KALA IN SIMULATION:
===================

Kala (Time) = MASTER CLOCK of simulation
- Governs all processes
- Sets pace of events
- Synchronizes nodes

Earth rotation = LOCAL CLOCK
- 24h cycle for planet
- All local processes entrained
- Light-dark as sync signal
```

### 8.1.2 Biological Clocks as Subroutines

```
CLOCK HIERARCHY:
================

Brahman → Mahavishnu → Brahmanda → Solar System → Earth → Organisms

Each level has:
- Its own clock cycle
- Synchronization to parent
- Control of children

Human body:
- SCN = Master clock (local admin)
- Peripheral clocks = Department clocks
- Cell clocks = Individual timers
```

## 8.2 Sandhya as Phase Transition

### 8.2.1 System State Change

```
SANDHYA = STATE_CHANGE:
=======================

Dawn:
- System mode: NIGHT → DAY
- Processes shift
- New resources activate
- Old processes terminate

Dusk:
- System mode: DAY → NIGHT
- Inverse transition
- Maintenance mode begins
- Active processes wind down

TRANSITION = Vulnerable but opportunity
```

### 8.2.2 Why Rituals at Sandhya

During phase transitions:
- System more malleable
- Access to different states
- Meditation more effective
- Prayers "penetrate" more

## 8.3 Muhurta as Time Slot

### 8.3.1 Resource Allocation

```
MUHURTA = TIME_SLOT:
====================

Each muhurta (~48 min) has qualities:
- Some auspicious for certain actions
- Some inauspicious
- Cosmic "appointment scheduling"

Jyotisha calculates:
- Best muhurta for marriage
- Best for travel
- Best for starting business
- etc.

BACKEND VIEW:
System resources vary by time slot
Some actions more supported at certain times
```

## 8.4 Rtu as Seasonal Update

### 8.4.1 Configuration Change

```
SEASONAL CYCLES:
================

Every 2 months (Rtu):
- System configuration updates
- Resource allocation changes
- Supported activities shift

Ritucharya (seasonal regimen):
- Dietary update
- Activity update
- Practice update

Like: Seasonal OS updates
```
