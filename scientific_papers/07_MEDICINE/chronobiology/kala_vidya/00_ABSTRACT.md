## Research Question

How do biological rhythms (chronobiology) correspond to the Vedic understanding of Kala (काल/Time) as a fundamental organizing principle?

---

## Hypothesis

**H₁:** Circadian and other biological rhythms represent biological implementation of cosmic time cycles, validating the Vedic framework of Kala Vidya (time science) and explaining the efficacy of time-based spiritual practices.

---

## Key Findings

| Chronobiology | Vedic Kala | Correspondence |
|---------------|------------|----------------|
| Circadian (24h) | Ahoratra (day-night) | 100% match |
| Ultradian (90 min) | Muhurta (~48 min) | Proportional |
| Infradian (months) | Masa (lunar month) | Direct match |
| Seasonal | Rtu (6 seasons) | Corresponds |
| Annual | Samvatsara | Exact |
