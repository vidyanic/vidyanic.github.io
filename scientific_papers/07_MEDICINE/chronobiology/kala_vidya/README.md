## Questions Answered

1. **Why do we have body rhythms?** -> Built into biology as cosmic synchronization
2. **Why 24-hour cycles?** -> Life evolved entrained to Earth's rotation
3. **What is the Vedic understanding?** -> Kala (Time) is a fundamental Tattva
4. **Why do Sandhya times matter?** -> They are phase transition points

|   CHRONOBIOLOGY DISCOVERY:                                          |
|   Life has built-in clocks — circadian (daily), ultradian           |
|   (shorter), infradian (longer). These synchronize biology          |
|   with cosmic cycles (day-night, lunar, seasonal, annual).          |
|                                                                     |
|   VEDIC KALA VIDYA:                                                 |
|   Time (Kala) is a fundamental principle. All dharmic practices    |
|   are timed: Sandhya (dawn/dusk), Brahma Muhurta (pre-dawn),       |
|   seasonal rituals, lunar observances. Biology follows cosmos.      |
|                                                                     |
|   SYNTHESIS:                                                        |
|   Circadian rhythms are the biological implementation of cosmic     |
|   time. The body is synchronized to the universe. Vedic timing     |
|   practices optimize this synchronization.                          |
|                                                                     |
