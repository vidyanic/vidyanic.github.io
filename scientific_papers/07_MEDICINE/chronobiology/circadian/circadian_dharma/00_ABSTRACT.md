# 00. ABSTRACT — Circadian Rhythms: The Body's Dharma Clock

---

## Research Statement

> **"कालोऽस्मि लोकक्षयकृत्प्रवृद्धो"**
> "Kalo'smi lokakshayakrit pravriddho"
> "I am Time, the great destroyer of worlds."
> — Bhagavad Gita 11.32

**Research Question:** Are circadian rhythms merely biological mechanisms, or are they the body's expression of Dharma — the natural order that must be followed for health and harmony?

---

## Key Findings

1. **Every cell has a clock** — Molecular mechanisms (2017 Nobel Prize) show 24-hour cycles in every cell.

2. **Disruption causes disease** — Shift work classified as probable carcinogen (WHO Group 2A). Circadian misalignment linked to cancer, obesity, diabetes, depression, heart disease.

3. **Dinacharya matches chronobiology** — Vedic daily routine prescriptions align precisely with modern circadian science.

4. **Time-specific activities** — Brahma Muhurta, noon digestion, 10 PM sleep — all validated by research.

5. **Alignment = Health** — Following circadian rhythm IS living in Dharma at the physiological level.

## Validated Correlations

| Frontend Finding | Backend Prescription | Confidence |
|------------------|---------------------|------------|
| Morning light sets clock | Wake at Brahma Muhurta | 95% |
| Peak digestion at noon | Largest meal midday | 90% |
| Repair happens 10 PM-2 AM | Sleep before 10 PM | 90% |
| Late eating disrupts | Light dinner early | 88% |
| Regularity essential | Consistent Dinacharya | 92% |

## Implications

Circadian rhythms are not just biology — they are the body's Dharma:
- **Following rhythm** = Living in Dharma = Health
- **Violating rhythm** = Living in Adharma = Disease

The 2017 Nobel Prize validated what Dinacharya (Vedic daily routine) prescribed thousands of years ago.
