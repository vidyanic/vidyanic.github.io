## 5.1 RESEARCH APPROACH

### Multi-Source Validation

```
VALIDATION SOURCES:
===================

1. CHRONOBIOLOGY RESEARCH
   • Nobel Prize work
   • Circadian mechanism studies
   • SCN and peripheral clock research

2. EPIDEMIOLOGY
   • Shift work disease studies
   • Time-restricted eating trials
   • Sleep timing research

3. CLINICAL STUDIES
   • Chrononutrition interventions
   • Chronotherapy outcomes
   • Sleep optimization research

4. AYURVEDIC TEXTS
   • Dinacharya protocols
   • Kala (time) teachings
   • Dosha-time correlations

5. POINT-BY-POINT CORRELATION
   • Each Dinacharya prescription
   • Matched to research finding
   • Confidence scored
```

## 5.2 DATA COLLECTION

### Scientific Literature

| Source Type | Databases | Focus |
|-------------|-----------|-------|
| Peer-reviewed | PubMed, ScienceDirect | Circadian biology |
| Clinical trials | ClinicalTrials.gov | Time interventions |
| Epidemiology | Cohort studies | Disruption outcomes |
| Reviews | Cochrane, systematic | Meta-analyses |

### Backend Sources

| Source | Content | Relevance |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| Ashtanga Hridayam | Dinacharya chapter | Primary |
| Charaka Samhita | Daily routine | Primary |
| Sushruta Samhita | Time and health | Secondary |
| Yoga texts | Brahma Muhurta | Secondary |

## 5.3 CORRELATION METHODOLOGY

### Mapping Process

```
STEP 1: Identify Dinacharya prescription
        (Traditional recommendation)
                |
                v
STEP 2: Search chronobiology literature
        (Modern research on same topic)
                |
                v
STEP 3: Compare timing/mechanism
        (Do they match?)
                |
                v
STEP 4: Assess evidence quality
        (Peer-review, replication)
                |
                v
STEP 5: Calculate confidence
        (Weighted scoring)
```

### Correlation Criteria

| Criterion | Definition | Weight |
|-----------|------------|--------|
| Time match | Same time window | 30% |
| Mechanism fit | Same biological process | 25% |
| Disease prevention | Same conditions addressed | 25% |
| Practical match | Same activities prescribed | 20% |

## 5.4 VALIDATION METRICS

### For Each Prescription

```
EVIDENCE QUALITY:
=================

A (95-100%): Multiple peer-reviewed studies, replicated
B (85-94%): Peer-reviewed, some replication
C (75-84%): Limited peer-review, case studies
D (65-74%): Preliminary research, anecdotal
F (<65%): Insufficient evidence
```

### Confidence Calculation

```
C = (S_timing × 0.30) + (S_mechanism × 0.25) + 
    (S_disease × 0.25) + (S_practical × 0.20)

WHERE:
S_timing = Time window match (0-100)
S_mechanism = Biological process match (0-100)
S_disease = Disease prevention match (0-100)
S_practical = Activity recommendation match (0-100)
```
