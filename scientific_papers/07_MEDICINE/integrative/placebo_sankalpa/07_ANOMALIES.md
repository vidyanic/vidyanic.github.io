# 07. ANOMALIES — Questions Answered

---

## 7.1 WHY DO SOME PEOPLE NOT RESPOND?

### The Question

```
NON-RESPONDERS:
===============

About 60-70% of people show placebo response.
30-40% don't respond significantly.

Why the difference?
```

### The Answer: Sankalpa Capacity Varies

```
RESPONSE DEPENDS ON:
====================

1. INTENTION CLARITY:
   Some people have clear, focused intention.
   Others have scattered, ambivalent intentions.

2. BELIEF STRENGTH:
   Some have strong Shraddha (faith).
   Others have doubt (Sanshaya).

3. GUNA STATE:
   Sattvic = best responders
   Tamasic = worst responders

4. GENETIC FACTORS:
   COMT gene variations affect dopamine
   Some brains are more "placebo-prone"

5. PREVIOUS CONDITIONING:
   Past positive experiences -> Better response
   Past disappointments -> Reduced response

NON-RESPONSE = Low Sankalpa capacity
(whether trait or state-based)

## 7.2 WHY DOES PLACEBO WORK ON ANIMALS?

### The Question

```
VETERINARY PLACEBO:
===================

Animals show placebo effects.
They don't have "beliefs" like humans.
How does this fit Sankalpa model?
```

### The Answer: Multiple Levels

```
ANIMAL PLACEBO MECHANISMS:
==========================

1. OWNER EXPECTATION:
   • Owner's belief affects behavior toward animal
   • Animal senses owner's state
   • Owner's Sankalpa affects animal

2. CONDITIONING:
   • Previous positive associations
   • Pavlovian response to ritual
   • Learned expectation

3. SUBTLE BODY EFFECTS:
   • Animals have Pranamaya Kosha
   • Energy transfer from healer
   • Collective field effects

4. REDUCED EFFECT:
   • Animal placebo IS weaker than human
   • Less cognitive mediation
   • But still present

The OWNER'S consciousness affects the animal.
Consciousness fields overlap.
```

## 7.3 WHY CAN'T PLACEBO CURE EVERYTHING?

### The Question

```
LIMITATIONS:
============

Placebo works for:
• Pain
• Mood
• Some immune function
• Functional disorders

Placebo DOESN'T work for:
• Cancer tumors (usually)
• Bacterial infection
• Broken bones
• Genetic diseases

Why the limitation?
```

### The Answer: Levels of Karma

```
SANKALPA POWER IS GRADUATED:
============================

Level 1: SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE
• Pain perception
• Mood state
• Anxiety level
-> MOST responsive to Sankalpa

Level 2: FUNCTIONAL SYSTEMS
• Immune regulation
• Hormone levels
• Autonomic function
-> MODERATE responsiveness

Level 3: STRUCTURAL ISSUES
• Tissue damage
• Genetic problems
• Anatomical defects
-> LEAST responsive

WHY?
• Stronger Karmic imprints resist change
• Physical structure = crystallized Karma
• Deeper Samskaras require stronger intervention
• Siddhis (higher Sankalpa) CAN affect structure
  (but rare)
```

## 7.4 WHY DOES NOCEBO EXIST?

### The Question

```
NOCEBO PROBLEM:
===============

If consciousness can heal (placebo),
why does it also harm (nocebo)?

Wouldn't evolution select against this?
```

### The Answer: Consciousness is Neutral

```
SANKALPA IS DIRECTION-NEUTRAL:
==============================

Consciousness doesn't care about direction.
It manifests WHAT YOU FOCUS ON.

POSITIVE FOCUS -> Positive manifestation
NEGATIVE FOCUS -> Negative manifestation

This is like:
• Fire can cook or burn
• Knife can heal (surgery) or harm
• Word can bless or curse

The TOOL is neutral.
The USER directs.

EVOLUTIONARY VALUE:
• Nocebo = Threat anticipation
• "Expect danger, prepare for it"
• Survival mechanism
• Just overactivated in modern context
```

## 7.5 WHY DO PLACEBOS WORK DIFFERENTLY IN DIFFERENT CULTURES?

### The Question

```
CULTURAL VARIATION:
===================

Placebo response varies by culture:
• Higher in some countries
• Different for different conditions
• Acupuncture placebo varies by region

Why?
```

### The Answer: Collective Sankalpa

```
CULTURAL BELIEF FIELD:
======================

Sankalpa operates in COLLECTIVE field:

WESTERN CULTURE:
• Pill = powerful medicine (strong belief)
• Acupuncture = "alternative" (weaker belief)
• Doctor = authority (strong)

CHINESE CULTURE:
• Acupuncture = real medicine (strong belief)
• Qi = natural force (cultural reality)
• Healer = respected (strong authority)

INDIVIDUAL SANKALPA + CULTURAL SANKALPA
= Total effect

You're drawing on collective belief.
That varies by culture.
```

## 7.6 WHY IS PLACEBO GETTING STRONGER?

### The Question

```
INCREASING PLACEBO:
===================

Placebo response has increased over decades.
Drug trials are harder because placebo works better.
Some drugs that worked before now fail vs placebo.

Why is this happening?
```

### The Answer: Rising Collective Belief

```
FACTORS:
=========

1. MEDICAL SUCCESS STORIES:
   • People BELIEVE medicine works
   • More success stories -> Stronger belief

2. IMPROVED CARE:
   • Better clinical environments
   • More attention to patients
   • Stronger ritual/context

3. INFORMATION AGE:
   • People know about placebo
   • Meta-awareness increases effect
   • "I know this might work" -> It works more

4. DWAPARA EFFECT:
   • Consciousness-matter interface strengthening
   • Manifestation becoming easier
   • Collective Sankalpa power increasing
```

## 7.7 WHY DOES PRICE AFFECT PLACEBO?

### The Question

```
PRICE EFFECT:
=============

More expensive placebo -> Stronger effect
$2.50 pill works better than $0.10 pill
(Same sugar, same appearance)

Why?
```

### The Answer: Value = Belief Amplifier

```
PRICE SIGNALS VALUE:
====================

1. CULTURAL EQUATION:
   Expensive = More valuable = More effective

2. INVESTMENT EFFECT:
   More invested -> More motivated to respond

3. AUTHORITY SIGNAL:
   High price = "Must be good"

4. COGNITIVE CONSISTENCY:
   "I paid a lot, it must work"
   (Reduce cognitive dissonance)

This is NOT irrational —
it's how Sankalpa gets amplified
through cultural meaning systems.
```
