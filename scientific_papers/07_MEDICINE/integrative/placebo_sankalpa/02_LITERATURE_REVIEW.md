# 02. LITERATURE REVIEW — Placebo Science and Sankalpa

## 2.1 PLACEBO EFFECT RESEARCH

### Historical Development

| Era | Development |
|-----|-------------|
| 1950s | First controlled placebo studies |
| 1960s | Ethical debates begin |
| 1990s | Neuroimaging of placebo |
| 2010s | Open-label placebo discovery |
| Now | Mechanism elucidation |

### Key Researchers

**Ted Kaptchuk (Harvard)**
- Open-label placebo studies
- Ritual and context effects
- "Even when you know" findings

**Fabrizio Benedetti (University of Turin)**
- Neurochemistry of placebo
- Endorphin mechanisms
- Comprehensive placebo research

**Irving Kirsch (Harvard)**
- Antidepressant placebo studies
- "The Emperor's New Drugs"
- Drug-placebo comparisons

## 2.2 LANDMARK STUDIES

### Sham Surgery (Moseley et al., 2002)

**Study:**
- Arthroscopic knee surgery for osteoarthritis
- 180 patients, randomized
- Real surgery vs. sham (incisions only)

**Result:**
- No difference at 2-year follow-up
- Sham as effective as real surgery
- Revolutionized understanding

### Open-Label Placebos (Kaptchuk et al., 2010)

**Study:**
- Irritable bowel syndrome patients
- Told explicitly "these are placebos"
- Still took pills twice daily

**Result:**
- 59% improved (vs. 35% no-treatment)
- Open knowledge didn't eliminate effect
- Belief in healing power sufficient

### Pain Studies (Benedetti et al.)

**Findings:**
- Placebo activates endorphin system
- Naloxone (opioid blocker) blocks placebo
- Same neural pathways as real drugs
- Dopamine system also involved

---

## 2.3 NEUROIMAGING EVIDENCE

### Brain Changes Visible

| Study Type | Finding |
|------------|---------|
| fMRI | Placebo activates same areas as drugs |
| PET | Neurotransmitter release measured |
| EEG | Brain wave changes documented |
| MRI | Even structural changes possible |

### Specific Activations

- **Prefrontal cortex** — Expectation processing
- **Anterior cingulate** — Pain modulation
- **Nucleus accumbens** — Reward anticipation
- **Periaqueductal gray** — Pain suppression

---

## 2.4 NOCEBO RESEARCH

### Evidence That Negative Works Too

| Study | Finding |
|-------|---------|
| Side effect warnings | More side effects when warned |
| Voodoo death | Documented death from belief |
| Negative prognosis | Worse outcomes when told "incurable" |
| Drug switching | Same drug, different label -> different side effects |

### Mechanism

- Same pathways as placebo (reversed)
- Cholecystokinin (CCK) involved in nocebo pain
- Stress hormones activated
- Immune suppression documented

## 2.5 VEDIC SOURCES

### Yoga Sutras (Patanjali)

```
SANKALPA IN YOGA:
=================

YS 1.2: "Yoga is the cessation of mind fluctuations"
YS 2.33: Pratipaksha Bhavana (counter-thought)
YS 4.1: "Siddhis come from birth, herbs, mantra,
         austerity, or SAMADHI"

The trained mind can achieve what
untrained mind cannot.
```

### Yoga Vasishtha

- Mind creates reality
- "As you think, so you become"
- Stories of sages manifesting

### Tantra

- Intention (Sankalpa) before ritual
- Will as creative power
- Mind directing Prana

---

## 2.6 PSYCHONEUROIMMUNOLOGY

### Mind-Immune Connection

**Key Findings:**
- Stress suppresses immunity (measurable)
- Relaxation enhances immunity
- Visualization affects immune cells
- Conditioning can train immune responses

### Conditioned Immune Response

**Ader & Cohen (1975):**
- Rats given immunosuppressant with sweetened water
- Later, sweetened water alone -> Immune suppression
- Classical conditioning of immune system

## 2.7 GAP IN LITERATURE

### What's Missing

1. **No mechanism** for how belief affects body
2. **No model** explaining open-label effectiveness
3. **No framework** integrating all findings
4. **No recognition** of Sankalpa as the mechanism

### This Paper Provides

- Sankalpa as the unifying mechanism
- Consciousness -> Prana -> Physical pathway
- Explanation of all placebo phenomena
- Ancient-modern integration
