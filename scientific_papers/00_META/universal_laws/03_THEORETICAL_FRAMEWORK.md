## 3.1 The Hierarchical Structure of Reality

The Backend Framework posits that reality is structured in a base-3 progression ($3^n$), reflecting the three Gunas (Sattva, Rajas, Tamas).

1. **The One (1):** Rta / Brahman (The Source)
2. **The Three (3):** The Gunas (The building blocks)
3. **The Nine (9):** The Core Nodes (The 81-Grid center)
4. **The Twenty-Seven (27):** Sub-specifications per layer
5. **The Eighty-One (81):** The complete Law set ($3 \times 27$)

## 3.2 Key Principles: The 54 Hyperparameters

While the 81 laws govern the OS, the **54 Principles** define the physics engine itself.

### 3.2.1 Foundational Principles
| Principle | Function | Simulation Analogy |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| **Purna** | Total information conservation | No data leakage |
| **Anu-Mahat** | Fractal self-similarity | LOD (Level of Detail) scaling |
| **Rta** | Universal constant enforcement | Hard-coded engine limits |
| **Maya** | On-demand rendering | Occlusion culling |
| **Karma** | Strict causality | Event logging |

## 3.3 The 81 Laws: The Operating System

The 81 Laws categorized into three domains ($27 + 27 + 27$):

### 3.3.1 Adhidaivika (Hardware Layer)
The laws governing the substrate of reality: Spacetime, Gravity, and the Constants.
- **Law #3:** The Speed of Light ($c$) is the "refresh rate" limit of the physical plane ($c = 1 \text{ px/tick}$).
- **Law #10:** Gravity is the attraction produced by **Tamas** (data weight).

### 3.3.2 Adhibhautika (Interface Layer)
The laws governing how energy and matter interact.
- **Law #30:** The **Trigunatmaka** principle $(S + R + T = 1)$. Every pixel has a ratio of order/energy/inertia.
- **Law #37:** The **5 Senses** are the data input APIs for the Jiva.

### 3.3.3 Adhyatmika (Software Layer)
The laws governing consciousness and the player's experience.
- **Law #55:** **Karma-Phala**. Every intentional action computes a return value.
- **Law #70:** **Drashta-Drishya**. The observer effect is the mechanism by which the simulation collapses potential into actual data.

## 3.4 Integration: How They Work Together

The framework represents a **Unified Field Theory** that includes consciousness:

$$\text{Reality} = \frac{\text{Sattva} \times \text{Dharma}}{\text{Rajas} + \text{Tamas}} \times \text{Observer Intent}$$

- **High Sattva:** High-resolution, stable, transparent reality.
- **High Tamas:** Low-resolution, heavy, sluggish, "dark" reality.
