## 8.1 The Simulation Framework

The Backend Framework describes reality using computational metaphors that predate computers by millennia:

| Backend Term | Computation Analog | Function |
|--------------|-------------------|----------|
| Brahman | Source Code | The absolute substrate |
| Maya | Render Engine | Projection system |
| Prakriti | Physics Engine | Rules of interaction |
| Karma | Event Logger | Action -> consequence |
| Samsara | Game Loop | Life -> death -> respawn |
| Moksha | Exit Function | Liberation from loop |

## 8.3 Why This Analogy Works

### 8.3.1 Rendering on Demand

**Game Engine:** Don't render what's behind the player (occlusion culling).

**Reality:** Particles don't exist definitively until observed (wave function collapse).

**Match:** ✅ Perfect

---

### 8.3.2 Level of Detail (LOD)

**Game Engine:** Distant objects rendered with less detail.

**Reality:** Heisenberg uncertainty — can't know everything at once.

**Match:** ✅ Perfect

---

### 8.3.3 Consistent Rules

**Game Engine:** Physics rules are hard-coded and can't be changed in-game.

**Reality:** Speed of light, conservation laws — never violated.

**Match:** ✅ Perfect

---

### 8.3.4 Respawn Mechanics

**Game Engine:** Player dies, respawns with some progress saved.

**Reality:** Death -> Antarabhava -> Rebirth with Karma (save file).

**Match:** ✅ Perfect

---

### 8.3.5 Admin Access

**Game Engine:** Developers can break normal rules.

**Reality:** Siddhis — abilities that transcend normal physics.

**Match:** ✅ Documented but rare

## 8.4 The Three-Layer Stack

### Layer 1: Hardware (Adhidaivika)

| Component | Backend Term | Modern Analog |
|-----------|--------------|---------------|
| Spacetime | Akasha | Game world volume |
| Constants | Rta | Hard-coded limits |
| Energy | Shakti | Processing power |

### Layer 2: Interface (Adhibhautika)

| Component | Backend Term | Modern Analog |
|-----------|--------------|---------------|
| Matter | Prakriti | Rendered objects |
| Senses | Indriyas | Input devices |
| Body | Sharira | Player avatar |

### Layer 3: Software (Adhyatmika)

| Component | Backend Term | Modern Analog |
|-----------|--------------|---------------|
| Mind | Manas | AI processing |
| Memory | Chitta | Data storage |
| Self | Atman | The player |

---

## 8.5 The Player vs. Character Distinction

**CRITICAL INSIGHT:**

```
CHARACTER (Avatar):
  - Body (Sharira)
  - Mind (Manas)  
  - Emotions (Bhava)
  - Memories (Chitta)
  - Personality (Svabhava)
  
  ALL of these are IN the game.

PLAYER (Atman):
  - Awareness
  - The witness
  - That which observes the character
  
  This is OUTSIDE the game.
  This is what you actually are.
```

## 8.6 Game Mechanics Mapped

| Game Concept | Backend Term | Function |
|--------------|--------------|----------|
| XP/Leveling | Karma | Actions = progress |
| Skill trees | Samskaras | Accumulated tendencies |
| Quest log | Prarabdha | Active karma |
| Inventory | Subtle body | Carries across lives |
| Respawn | Reincarnation | New avatar, same player |
| Cheat codes | Siddhis | Admin access |
| Main menu | Moksha | Exit the game |

---

## 8.7 Implications

If reality IS a simulation-like system:

1. **Physics is not discovery but reverse-engineering**
2. **Consciousness is the player, not an emergent property**
3. **Death is logout, not game over**
4. **"Miracles" are just accessing admin features**
5. **Liberation is remembering you're the player**
