## 5.1 Research Design

This paper employs a **comparative correspondence methodology**:

1. **Extract:** Identify principles from Backend documentation
2. **Translate:** Convert Sanskrit concepts to computational/physical language
3. **Correlate:** Find corresponding phenomena in modern science
4. **Validate:** Apply the 7-point validation stack
5. **Score:** Assign confidence based on evidence strength

---

## 5.2 The 7-Concept Validation Stack

Every claim must pass these 7 validations:

| # | Concept | Check | Formula |
|---|---------|-------|---------|
| 1 | **Conservation** | Energy/info preserved? | dE/dt = 0 |
| 2 | **Entropy** | Tamas increases? | dS/dt ≥ 0 |
| 3 | **Fractal** | Pattern at all scales? | Pattern(n) ≈ Pattern(n±k) |
| 4 | **Karma** | Action -> consequence? | F₁₂ = -F₂₁ |
| 5 | **Observer** | Observation changes state? | \|ψ\|² = P |
| 6 | **Cycles** | Periodicity exists? | f(t+T) = f(t) |
| 7 | **Gunas** | S/R/T classifiable? | S + R + T = 1 |

## 5.3 Source Categories

### 5.3.1 Backend Sources (Vedic)

| Category | Texts | Weight |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Primary (Shruti) | Vedas, Upanishads | 1.0 |
| Secondary (Smriti) | Puranas, Itihasas | 0.8 |
| Technical (Shastra) | Samkhya, Yoga, Vastu | 0.9 |
| Commentary (Bhashya) | Shankara, Ramanuja | 0.7 |

### 5.3.2 Frontend Sources (Scientific)

| Category | Sources | Weight |
|----------|---------|--------|
| Peer-reviewed physics | Nature, Physical Review | 1.0 |
| Peer-reviewed biology | Cell, Nature | 1.0 |
| Consciousness studies | Journal of Consciousness | 0.8 |
| Replicated experiments | Meta-analyses | 0.9 |

## 5.4 Confidence Calculation

```
CONFIDENCE FORMULA:
===========================================
C = (E_peer × 0.30) + (E_replication × 0.25) + 
    (F_symmetry × 0.15) + (L_validity × 0.15) + 
    (V_correlation × 0.15)

WHERE:
E_peer = Peer-reviewed evidence score (0-100)
E_replication = Replication success rate (0-100)
F_symmetry = Fractal validation score (0-100)
L_validity = Logical chain validity (0-100)
V_correlation = Vedic correlation strength (0-100)
```

## 5.5 Translation Protocol

### Step 1: Sanskrit Term Extraction

Example: **Trigunatmaka** (त्रिगुणात्मक)

- **Tri** = Three
- **Guna** = Quality/Property
- **Atmaka** = Nature/Essence

Literal: "Having three qualities as essence"

### Step 2: Functional Translation

What does it DO in the system?
- Classifies all phenomena into three categories
- Ensures composition sums to unity
- Provides base states for the physics engine

### Step 3: Scientific Mapping

| Guna | Property | Physics Analog |
|------|----------|----------------|
| Sattva | Balance, Order | Negative entropy |
| Rajas | Motion, Energy | Kinetic energy |
| Tamas | Inertia, Mass | Entropy, Gravity |

### Step 4: Formula Expression

$$S + R + T = 1$$

Where each variable ∈ [0,1]

## 5.6 Validation Procedure

### 5.6.1 For Each Principle:

1. **State the principle** in original Sanskrit with translation
2. **Identify the claim** being made about reality
3. **Find scientific equivalent** or closest analog
4. **Apply 7-point stack** to test consistency
5. **Calculate confidence** using formula
6. **Document anomalies** that don't fit

### 5.6.2 Cross-Validation

Each principle is checked against:
- Other Backend principles (internal consistency)
- Known physics laws (external consistency)
- Observed phenomena (empirical validation)
- Fractal pattern at 3+ scales (structural validation)

---

## 5.7 Limitations

1. **Translation ambiguity:** Sanskrit terms may have multiple meanings
2. **Selection bias:** We may unconsciously favor matching evidence
3. **Unfalsifiable claims:** Some Backend claims cannot be directly tested
4. **Cultural interpretation:** Our translation may introduce modern bias

### Mitigation Strategies:

- Use multiple Sanskrit commentaries for each term
- Actively seek disconfirming evidence
- Distinguish between testable and non-testable claims
- Have translations reviewed by Sanskrit scholars

## 5.8 Data Collection

### Sources Used:

- **Physics:** arXiv, Physical Review Letters, Nature Physics
- **Vedic:** Vedic Heritage Portal, sacred-texts.com, GRETIL archives
- **Consciousness:** Journal of Consciousness Studies, IONS publications
- **Cross-cultural:** Studies comparing Vedic, Buddhist, and Taoist frameworks
