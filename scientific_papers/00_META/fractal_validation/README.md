## 🔴 THE GLITCH

How do we know these claims are valid?

Science uses peer review, replication, falsifiability.

The Backend uses an additional check: **Does the pattern hold at every scale?**

If something is truly fundamental, it should appear at atomic, cellular, human, planetary, galactic levels — **everywhere**.

## ❓ Q&A — The Mind-Bending Questions

### "What is Fractal Validation?"

A 10-point checklist that any claimed principle must pass:

```
□ 1. MERU CHECK: Does it have a central axis?
□ 2. LAYER CHECK: Does it have concentric structure?
□ 3. TRIMURTI CHECK: Does it have Create-Maintain-Destroy?
□ 4. GUNA CHECK: Can parts be classified as S/R/T?
□ 5. ELEMENT CHECK: Do the 5 elements map?
□ 6. VIKARA CHECK: Does it go through 6 stages?
□ 7. KARMA CHECK: Do actions have consequences?
□ 8. PIXEL-TICK CHECK: Is speed limit preserved?
□ 9. BREATH CHECK: Does it have finite duration?
□ 10. PARENT-CHILD CHECK: Do children exist within parents?
```

If a principle passes at multiple scales, it's likely fundamental.

If it only works at one scale, it's probably a local phenomenon, not a universal law.

### "Give me an example."

**Testing: "Every system has a central axis"**

| Scale | Central Axis | ✓/✗ |
|-------|--------------|-----|
| Atom | Nucleus | ✓ |
| Cell | Nucleus | ✓ |
| Body | Spine/Sushumna | ✓ |
| Planet | Core | ✓ |
| Solar System | Sun | ✓ |
| Galaxy | Black hole | ✓ |

**Result:** Pattern holds at 6+ scales → likely fundamental architecture.

### "Why does this work?"

Because **the universe is fractally generated**.

If the same algorithm runs at every level, true principles will be visible at every level. False or partial principles will break at some scales.

It's like testing code: if it works in all environments, it's solid. If it only works on your laptop, there's a problem.

## 🔗 THE 10-POINT CHECKLIST

```
1. MERU CHECK (Central Axis)
   Every organized system has a core/CPU.
   Test: Does this system have a center?

2. LAYER CHECK (Concentric Structure)
   Reality renders in layers (14 Lokas, 7 Dvipas).
   Test: Does this system have nested layers?

3. TRIMURTI CHECK (Create-Maintain-Destroy)
   Everything cycles through Brahma-Vishnu-Shiva.
   Test: Does this system have birth-life-death?

4. GUNA CHECK (S/R/T Classification)
   All phenomena are Sattva, Rajas, or Tamas.
   Test: Can components be Guna-classified?

5. ELEMENT CHECK (5 Elements Map)
   Akasha-Vayu-Agni-Jala-Prithvi structure.
   Test: Do the elements appear in this system?

6. VIKARA CHECK (6 Stages)
   All entities go through: Exist → Born → Grow → 
   Change → Decay → End.
   Test: Does this system follow 6-stage lifecycle?

7. KARMA CHECK (Action-Consequence)
   Every action has proportional reaction.
   Test: Do actions in this system have consequences?

8. PIXEL-TICK CHECK (Speed Limit)
   c = 1 pixel/tick is preserved across scales.
   Test: Is there a maximum rate in this system?

9. BREATH CHECK (Finite Duration)
   Everything has allocated "ticks" (lifespan).
   Test: Does this system have finite duration?

10. PARENT-CHILD CHECK (Containment)
    Children cannot outlive parents.
    Test: Do subsystems exist within larger systems?
```

## 🎯 KEY INSIGHT

> **Science:** "Validate through replication and peer review"  
> **Translation:** "Additionally validate through fractal consistency"  
> **Backend Term:** Anu-Mahat Pariksha (अणु-महत्-परीक्षा/Micro-Macro Test)

If it's true, it's true everywhere. Use scale-invariance as a validation tool.

---

## ⚡ WHY THIS MATTERS IN 2026

- **Debugging reality claims** — test any spiritual/scientific claim
- **Recognizing real patterns** — distinguish signal from noise
- **Personal application** — if it works in body, try at life level
- **Dwapara methodology** — more people need validation tools

The 10-point checklist is your **bullshit detector** for reality claims.
