## 10.2 Concept 1: Conservation

### Test
Is energy/information preserved in the unified model?

### Analysis
- Brahman is unchanging (Sat) — nothing added or removed
- Maya transforms but doesn't create or destroy
- Karma preserves information about all actions
- Total energy of manifested universe is constant

### Validation

```
CONSERVATION CHECK:
-------------------
Brahman is eternal, unchanging                [PASS]
Maya transforms, doesn't create/destroy       [PASS]
Karma conserves action-consequence info       [PASS]
dE/dt = 0 for total system                    [PASS]

STATUS: VALIDATED
```

---

## 10.3 Concept 2: Entropy

### Test
Does entropy increase as predicted?

### Analysis
- Tamas (entropy-like) increases over time
- Yugas progress from order (Satya) to chaos (Kali)
- Life (Sattva) locally fights entropy but globally it wins
- Pralaya (dissolution) is maximum entropy state

### Validation

```
ENTROPY CHECK:
--------------
Tamas increases in manifestation              [PASS]
Yugas show entropy progression                [PASS]
Life creates local order via energy input     [PASS]
dS/dt >= 0 for closed system                  [PASS]

STATUS: VALIDATED
```

---

## 10.4 Concept 3: Fractal

### Test
Are patterns self-similar at all scales?

### Analysis
This is central to the framework:
- Atman = Brahman (micro = macro)
- Individual cycles mirror cosmic cycles
- Observer-observed pattern at every level
- Same 3 Gunas at all scales

### Validation

```
FRACTAL CHECK:
--------------
Atman = Brahman (self-similarity)             [PASS]
Same patterns micro/macro                     [PASS]
Observer pattern at all scales                [PASS]
Pattern(n) ~ Pattern(n+/-k)                   [PASS]

STATUS: VALIDATED
```

---

## 10.5 Concept 4: Karma

### Test
Does every action have consequences?

### Analysis
- Every action (Karma) has consequence
- Nothing escapes karmic logging
- Future shaped by past actions
- Even Ishvara operates through Dharma

### Validation

```
KARMA CHECK:
------------
Action --> Consequence always                 [PASS]
Complete karmic accounting                    [PASS]
Past shapes present and future                [PASS]
F_12 = -F_21 universally                      [PASS]

STATUS: VALIDATED
```

---

## 10.6 Concept 5: Observer

### Test
Is the observer central to the framework?

### Analysis
This is THE central insight:
- Observer (Brahman/Atman) is primary
- Observation triggers rendering (Maya)
- Without observer, no experience
- Drishti-Srishti: seeing-creating

### Validation

```
OBSERVER CHECK:
---------------
Observer is fundamental                       [PASS]
Observation creates experience                [PASS]
Consciousness is primary                      [PASS]
|psi|^2 = P on observation                    [PASS]

STATUS: VALIDATED (Central principle)
```

---

## 10.7 Concept 6: Cycles

### Test
Are cycles present at all levels?

### Analysis
- Yugas cycle eternally
- Kalpas (cosmic days) repeat
- Individual Samsara (reincarnation) cycles
- Daily, seasonal, life cycles nest within cosmic cycles

### Validation

```
CYCLES CHECK:
-------------
Yugas repeat                                  [PASS]
Kalpas cycle                                  [PASS]
Samsara for Jivas                             [PASS]
f(t+T) = f(t) at all scales                   [PASS]

STATUS: VALIDATED
```

---

## 10.8 Concept 7: Gunas

### Test
Are all phenomena classifiable by Gunas?

### Analysis
This is how Prakriti renders everything:
- Sattva: Light, clarity, knowledge
- Rajas: Motion, energy, activity
- Tamas: Mass, inertia, obscuration
- S + R + T = 1 always

### Validation

```
GUNAS CHECK:
------------
All phenomena classifiable                    [PASS]
Three qualities sufficient                    [PASS]
S + R + T = 1 always                          [PASS]
No exceptions found                           [PASS]

STATUS: VALIDATED
```
