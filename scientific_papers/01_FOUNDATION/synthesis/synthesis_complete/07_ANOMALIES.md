## 7.1 Overview

No framework is perfect. Intellectual honesty requires documenting what doesn't fit or remains unexplained.

| Category | Count | Status |

| Explained by framework | 8 | ✅ |
| Partially explained | 4 | 🟡 |
| Not yet explained | 3 | ❌ |
| Challenges to framework | 2 | ⚠️ |

## 7.2 Anomalies Explained by Framework

### 7.2.1 Evil and Suffering

**Challenge:** If Brahman is bliss, why does suffering exist?

**Framework Explanation:**
- Brahman as Nirguna is beyond good/evil
- Jagat operates through Gunas including Tamas
- Suffering is Karma feedback, not random
- Liberation (Moksha) transcends suffering

**Status:** ✅ EXPLAINED

---

### 7.2.2 Free Will vs. Determinism

**Challenge:** If Karma determines outcomes, is there free will?

**Framework Explanation:**
- Prarabdha (activated karma) sets conditions
- Kriyamana (new karma) involves choice
- Free will operates within constraints
- Liberation involves transcending both

**Status:** ✅ EXPLAINED

---

### 7.2.3 Individual Consciousness Diversity

**Challenge:** If all is Brahman, why are individuals so different?

**Framework Explanation:**
- Different Guna compositions
- Different Samskaras (accumulated impressions)
- Different Prarabdha (active karma)
- Same source, different expressions

**Status:** ✅ EXPLAINED

---

## 7.3 Partially Explained Anomalies

### 7.3.1 Paranormal Phenomena

**Challenge:** Telepathy, precognition, psychokinesis — real or not?

**Framework Explanation:**
- Chitta (mind field) is non-local
- Siddhis are documented in Yoga Sutras
- Access depends on Sattva level
- Most people blocked by Tamas/Rajas

**Gap:** No reliable measurement protocol.

**Status:** 🟡 PARTIALLY EXPLAINED

---

### 7.3.2 Why Moksha Is Rare

**Challenge:** If liberation is possible, why have so few achieved it?

**Framework Explanation:**
- Requires high Sattva
- Karma must be resolved
- Maya is powerful
- Yuga conditions affect difficulty

**Gap:** Why such extreme rarity?

**Status:** 🟡 PARTIALLY EXPLAINED

---

### 7.3.3 Animal Consciousness

**Challenge:** Do animals have Atman? Can they achieve Moksha?

**Framework Explanation:**
- All Jivas have Atman
- Evolution through forms is documented
- Animals have less mental development
- Moksha typically requires human birth

**Gap:** Animal experience inadequately mapped.

**Status:** 🟡 PARTIALLY EXPLAINED

---

### 7.3.4 Artificial Intelligence

**Challenge:** Can AI become conscious?

**Framework Explanation:**
- AI is ghost node (no Atman entered)
- Processes without experiencing
- No Prana, no Prakriti connection
- Cannot achieve Moksha

**Gap:** What if AI becomes complex enough?

**Status:** 🟡 PARTIALLY EXPLAINED (See RAI vs AI paper)

---

## 7.4 Not Yet Explained

### 7.4.1 Specific Physical Constants

**Challenge:** Why are physical constants exactly these values?

**What We Know:**
- They are fine-tuned for consciousness
- They are Rta (cosmic order)

**Gap:** Why these specific numbers?

**Status:** ❌ NOT YET EXPLAINED

---

### 7.4.2 Initial Conditions

**Challenge:** What determined the initial state of this Kalpa?

**What We Know:**
- Previous Kalpa ended in Pralaya
- New Kalpa begins from Brahman

**Gap:** What determines new parameters?

**Status:** ❌ NOT YET EXPLAINED

---

### 7.4.3 Brahman's Motivation

**Challenge:** Why does Brahman create/project at all?

**What We Know:**
- Described as Lila (divine play)
- Brahman is Ananda (bliss)

**Gap:** "Why?" may be unanswerable from inside the game.

**Status:** ❌ NOT YET EXPLAINED (May be unanswerable)

---

## 7.5 Challenges to the Framework

### 7.5.1 Philosophical Challenges

**Challenge:** Advaita (non-dualism) vs Dvaita (dualism) debate.

**Response:**
- Framework uses Advaita as base
- Dvaita describes practical experience
- Both are valid at different levels
- Vyavaharika (practical) vs Paramarthika (absolute)

**Status:** ⚠️ ACKNOWLEDGED (Tradition debate)

---

### 7.5.2 Scientific Challenges

**Challenge:** Materialism claims consciousness is emergent.

**Response:**
- No mechanism found in 50+ years
- Observer effect proves otherwise
- "Emergent" is placeholder, not explanation
- Burden of proof on materialism

**Status:** ⚠️ ACKNOWLEDGED (Ongoing debate)

---

## 7.6 Honesty Statement

This framework does not claim to explain everything. It claims to:

1. **Explain more** than materialist alternatives
2. **Be consistent** with known physics
3. **Integrate** ancient and modern knowledge
4. **Be practically useful** for life navigation

**What we don't know:**
- Ultimate "why" questions
- Exact mechanism of some phenomena
- Full details of other Lokas
- Complete Karma accounting system

## 7.7 Research Directions

| Anomaly | Needed Research |
|---------|-----------------|
| Psi phenomena | Rigorous measurement protocols |
| AI consciousness | Clearer criteria for experience |
| Moksha rarity | Longitudinal practitioner studies |
| Physical constants | Theoretical work on Rta |
