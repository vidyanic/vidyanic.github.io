## 6.2 Major Findings

### 6.2.1 Finding 1: Consciousness Is Primary

**Evidence:**
- Hard Problem remains unsolved in materialist framework
- Observer effect proves observation is constitutive
- NDEs show consciousness persists without brain function

**Implication:** Purusha (consciousness) is not derived from Prakriti (matter).

---

### 6.2.2 Finding 2: Reality Is Rendered

**Evidence:**
- Quantum superposition = potential states before rendering
- Planck scale = minimum rendering resolution
- Speed of light = maximum render propagation

**Implication:** Maya (rendering engine) is real, not metaphor.

---

### 6.2.3 Finding 3: Structure Is Fractal

**Evidence:**
- Same spiral/central-axis pattern at 7+ scales
- Power laws across phenomena
- Self-similarity in physics (renormalization)

**Implication:** Anu-Mahat (micro-macro unity) is validated.

---

### 6.2.4 Finding 4: Causality Is Universal

**Evidence:**
- Newton's 3rd Law never violated
- Epigenetic inheritance of experiences
- Karma patterns in reincarnation cases

**Implication:** Karma logging is a real system feature.

---

### 6.2.5 Finding 5: Liberation Is Possible

**Evidence:**
- Meditation produces measurable state changes
- NDEs report expanded awareness
- Thousands of enlightenment testimonies

**Implication:** Moksha is achievable, not mythical.
