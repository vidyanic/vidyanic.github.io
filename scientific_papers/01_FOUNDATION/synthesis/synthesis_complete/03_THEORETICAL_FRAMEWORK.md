## 3.2 The Components in Detail

### 3.2.1 Brahman (The Substrate)

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Nature | Sat-Chit-Ananda (Being-Consciousness-Bliss) |
| Permanence | Eternal, unchanging |
| Relationship | Source and substance of all |
| Analog | The screen on which movies play |

### 3.2.2 Maya (The Rendering Engine)

| Function | Mechanism |
|----------|-----------|
| Veiling (Avarana) | Hides the unity |
| Projecting (Vikshepa) | Creates multiplicity |
| Real status | Neither real nor unreal (Anirvachaniya) |
| Analog | GPU that renders graphics |

### 3.2.3 Prakriti (The Physics Engine)

| Component | Function |
|-----------|----------|
| Sattva | Light, clarity, order |
| Rajas | Motion, energy, change |
| Tamas | Mass, inertia, darkness |
| Formula | S + R + T = 1 (always) |

### 3.2.4 The Five Koshas (Player's Interface)

| Layer | Sanskrit | Function |
|-------|----------|----------|
| 1 | Annamaya | Physical body (hardware) |
| 2 | Pranamaya | Energy body (power supply) |
| 3 | Manomaya | Mental body (operating system) |
| 4 | Vijnanamaya | Wisdom body (higher processing) |
| 5 | Anandamaya | Bliss body (core experience) |
| Core | Atman | The player (beyond all layers) |

---

## 3.3 The Key Processes

### 3.3.1 Creation (Srishti)

```
Brahman -> (through Maya) -> Prakriti -> (3 Gunas) -> 5 Elements -> World
```

### 3.3.2 Maintenance (Sthiti)

```
Dharma governs -> Karma logs -> Consequences manifest -> Balance maintained
```

### 3.3.3 Dissolution (Laya)

```
World -> merges into Prakriti -> into Maya -> into Brahman (Pralaya)
```

### 3.3.4 Liberation (Moksha)

```
Jiva -> recognizes Atman -> realizes Atman = Brahman -> Liberation
```

---

## 3.4 The Operating Equations

### 3.4.1 Guna Normalization

$$S + R + T = 1$$

All phenomena are combinations of the three Gunas.

### 3.4.2 Karma Conservation

$$\sum K_{in} = \sum K_{out}$$

All actions have consequences; nothing escapes.

### 3.4.3 Fractal Scaling

$$Pattern(N) \approx Pattern(N \pm k)$$

Same structure at all scales.

### 3.4.4 Observer Dependency

$$|\psi|^2 = P_{observation}$$

Reality manifests through observation.

## 3.5 The Integration Model

How all parts connect:

      (Consciousness)              (Rendering)
            |                             |
            +-------------+---------------+

                     (Physics)
                          |
        +--------+--------+--------+
        |        |        |        |
     SATTVA   RAJAS    TAMAS    DHARMA
    (Order)  (Motion) (Mass)   (Rules)
        |        |        |        |
        +--------+--------+--------+
                          |
                       JAGAT
                      (World)

               +----------+-----------+
               |          |           |
            JIVA       KARMA       LOKAS
         (Players)   (Logging)  (Frequency)
```

## 3.6 Relationship to Science

| Scientific Concept | Framework Equivalent |
|--------------------|---------------------|
| Quantum field | Brahman (substrate) |
| Wave function | Maya (potential) |
| Particles | Prakriti manifestation |
| Conservation laws | Dharma (cosmic order) |
| Entropy | Tamas dominance |
| Observer effect | Purusha creating Drishya |

---

## 3.7 The Unified Thesis

**Everything is One consciousness (Brahman) appearing as Many through Maya's projection, experienced by Itself (as Jiva) through Prakriti's modulations (Gunas), governed by Dharma's laws (Karma), with the purpose of experience (Lila) and self-recognition (Moksha).**
