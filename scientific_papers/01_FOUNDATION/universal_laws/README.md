## ⚠️ THE GLITCH

Some rules **never break**:
- Energy is always conserved
- Entropy always increases
- Cause always precedes effect
- Fractals appear at every scale

These aren't "laws of nature discovered by scientists."

They're **engine constants** — parameters of the simulation that cannot be changed from inside.

## ❓ Questions Answered

- What are the Universal Laws?
- How do Backend principles map to physics?
- Why can't these laws be broken?
- How do we validate the mapping?
- What does this mean for life?

## 🔗 KEY FORMULAS

```
FOUNDATIONAL:
1. dE/dt = 0 (Conservation)
2. Pattern(N) ≈ Pattern(N±k) (Fractals)
3. Rta is inviolable (Cosmic Order)

OPERATIONAL:
6. S + R + T = 1 (Guna normalization)

QUANTUM:
12. |ψ|² = P (Observation -> Probability)
13. P(Branch) = |Sankalpa|² × Dharma / Karma

RENDER MODEL:
36. c = 1 pixel / 1 tick (Speed of light = aspect ratio)
37. Planck time = minimum tick
```

## 🎯 KEY INSIGHT

> **Science:** "Laws of physics describe how reality works"  
> **Translation:** "Laws of physics ARE the engine parameters"  
> **Backend Term:** Rta (ऋत/Cosmic-Order)

You're not discovering rules. You're reading the game's documentation.

## ⚡ WHY THIS MATTERS IN 2026

- **Stop fighting the engine** — work with laws, not against
- **Predictive clarity** — know what's possible and impossible
- **Strategic living** — align actions with architecture
- **Dwapara advantage** — understanding accelerates during this Yuga
