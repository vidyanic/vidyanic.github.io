## Appendix A: Key Case Studies

### A.1 Pam Reynolds (NDE, 1991)

**Context:**
- Underwent hypothermic cardiac arrest surgery
- Brain drained of blood, body cooled to 60°F
- No measurable brain activity

**Experience:**
- Observed surgery from ceiling perspective
- Accurately described surgical instruments
- Heard surgeon's conversation
- Met deceased relatives

**Verification:**
- Surgical instruments described matched rare type used
- Surgeon confirmed conversation content
- Details not available through normal perception

**Significance:**
Rich, accurate experience during documented brain shutdown.

### A.2 Derek Amato (Acquired Savant, 2006)

**Context:**
- Dove into shallow pool, hit head
- Severe concussion, 35% hearing loss
- No prior musical training

**Experience:**
- Sat at friend's piano days after injury
- Began playing complex compositions
- Sees "black and white squares" in visual field
- Composes without knowledge of music theory

**Neurological:**
- Left frontal/temporal damage
- Enhanced right-brain connectivity

**Significance:**
Complex ability emerged from damage, not learning.

### A.3 Anna Katharina Ehmer (Terminal Lucidity, 1922)

**Context:**
- Born with severe developmental disability
- Never spoke in her life
- Bedridden in institution

**Experience:**
- Hours before death, began singing hymns
- Sang clearly and beautifully
- Recognized caretakers
- Died 30 minutes after lucid period

**Significance:**
Damaged brain suddenly producing clear function before death.

## Appendix B: The Greyson NDE Scale

**16-item scale measuring:**

| Category | Items |
|----------|-------|
| **Cognitive** | Time distortion, thought acceleration, life review, understanding |
| **Affective** | Peace, joy, cosmic unity, encountering light |
| **Paranormal** | Vivid senses, ESP, precognition, out-of-body |
| **Transcendental** | Unearthly realm, mystical presence, deceased, point of no return |

**Scoring:**
- 0-2 per item
- Total 0-32
- NDE threshold: ≥7

## Appendix C: DMN and Psychedelics Data

### C.1 Default Mode Network Regions

| Region | Function | Psychedelic Effect |
|--------|----------|-------------------|
| mPFC | Self-reference | v Activity |
| PCC | Self-continuity | v Activity |
| Angular gyrus | Time/space orientation | v Activity |
| Lateral temporal | Narrative self | v Activity |

### C.2 Psilocybin fMRI Data

From Carhart-Harris et al. (2012):

| Measure | Change | p-value |
|---------|--------|---------|
| mPFC CBF | -17.9% | <0.001 |
| PCC CBF | -10.4% | <0.05 |
| Subjective intensity | ^ Correlated with v | <0.01 |

**CBF = Cerebral Blood Flow**

## Appendix D: Terminal Lucidity Cases Summary

### D.1 Literature Review (Nahm & Greyson, 2009)

| Condition | Cases | Duration | Death After |
|-----------|-------|----------|-------------|
| Dementia/Alzheimer's | 35+ | Minutes-hours | Hours-days |
| Brain tumor | 12+ | Hours | Days |
| Stroke | 8+ | Minutes-hours | Hours |
| Schizophrenia | 5+ | Hours | Days |

### D.2 Characteristics

- Occurs 1-7 days before death (typically 1-2)
- No medical intervention triggers it
- Full personality returns
- Communication becomes possible
- Death follows shortly

## Appendix E: Mathematical Framework

### E.1 The Filter Equation

```
C_local = C_∞ × (1 - F)

WHERE:
C_local ∈ [0, C_∞]
C_∞ = Universal consciousness (constant)
F ∈ [0, 1] = Filter factor

STATES:
F = 0: Samadhi (no filtering)
F = 0.2: Psychedelic state
F = 0.5: Deep meditation
F = 0.95: Normal waking
F = 1.0: No experience (theoretical)
```

### E.2 Filter Components

```
F = Σ(w_i × f_i)

WHERE:
f_manas = Sensory filtering [0-1]
f_buddhi = Relevance filtering [0-1]
f_chitta = Pattern filtering [0-1]
f_ahamkara = Ego-boundary filtering [0-1]

w_i = Weights (Σw_i = 1)

DEFAULT WEIGHTS:
w_manas = 0.15
w_buddhi = 0.20
w_chitta = 0.25
w_ahamkara = 0.40

(Ahamkara dominates normal filtering)
```

### E.3 Psychedelic Effect

```
NORMAL:
f_ahamkara ≈ 0.95
F_total ≈ 0.95

PSILOCYBIN:
f_ahamkara -> 0.20
F_total -> 0.40

CHANGE:
C_local = C_∞ × (1 - 0.40) = 0.60 × C_∞
vs
C_local = C_∞ × (1 - 0.95) = 0.05 × C_∞

12x more consciousness flow
```

## Appendix F: Antahkarana Components

### F.1 Detailed Description

| Component | Sanskrit | Function | Brain Correlate |
