## 5.1 Research Approach

This paper employs **meta-analysis** of existing research combined with **logical analysis** of model predictions.

### 5.1.1 Evidence Categories

| Category | Data Type | Primary Sources |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|
| **NDEs** | Case studies, prospective studies | Van Lommel, Parnia, AWARE |
| **Psychedelics** | fMRI, EEG, subjective reports | Carhart-Harris, Imperial College |
| **Terminal Lucidity** | Case documentation | Nahm, Greyson |
| **Savant Syndrome** | Neurological studies | Treffert, Snyder |

## 5.2 Inclusion Criteria

### 5.2.1 For NDE Studies

- Prospective design (not retrospective only)
- Documentation of clinical death or cardiac arrest
- Standardized measurement (Greyson Scale)
- Attempts at veridical verification

### 5.2.2 For Psychedelic Studies

- Neuroimaging (fMRI or EEG)
- Controlled administration
- Standardized subjective measures
- Peer-reviewed publication

### 5.2.3 For Terminal Lucidity

- Documented prior cognitive impairment
- Sudden return of clarity
- Medical verification
- Publication in peer-reviewed journal or credible documentation

### 5.2.4 For Savant Studies

- Documented brain injury/change
- Emergence of new abilities
- Abilities not previously trained
- Neurological assessment

---

## 5.3 Evaluation Framework

### 5.3.1 Model Comparison

For each evidence type, we compare:

```
GENERATOR MODEL PREDICTION:
What would happen if brain produces consciousness?

RECEIVER MODEL PREDICTION:
What would happen if brain filters consciousness?

OBSERVED:
What actually happens?

CONCLUSION:
Which model better fits?
```

### 5.3.2 Scoring System

| Match Quality | Score | Meaning |
|---------------|-------|---------|
| Strong match | 3 | Prediction precisely fulfilled |
| Moderate match | 2 | Prediction partially fulfilled |
| Weak match | 1 | Some alignment |
| No match | 0 | Prediction fails |
| Contradiction | -1 | Observation opposite to prediction |

## 5.4 Specific Methodologies

### 5.4.1 NDE Analysis

**Data Sources:**
- Van Lommel Lancet study (2001): n=344
- AWARE Study (2014): n=2,060
- Greyson database: 1,000+ cases

**Analysis:**
- Percentage with experiences during documented cardiac arrest
- Veridical perception verification rate
- Correlation with duration of arrest

### 5.4.2 Psychedelic Analysis

**Data Sources:**
- Carhart-Harris psilocybin studies (2012, 2016)
- DMT neuroimaging studies
- LSD brain connectivity studies

**Analysis:**
- Direction of brain activity change
- Correlation with subjective experience intensity
- Specific regions affected (DMN focus)

### 5.4.3 Terminal Lucidity Analysis

**Data Sources:**
- Nahm & Greyson systematic review
- Case collections from hospice literature
- Documented medical cases

**Analysis:**
- Prior cognitive state severity
- Duration of lucidity
- Time to death after lucidity

### 5.4.4 Savant Analysis

**Data Sources:**
- Treffert savant database
- Acquired savant case studies
- TMS studies on latent abilities

**Analysis:**
- Type of brain change/injury
- Type of ability emerged
- Relationship between injury location and ability

## 5.5 Limitations

### 5.5.1 Acknowledged Limitations

1. **NDEs:** Self-report nature, timing uncertainty
2. **Psychedelics:** Altered states hard to quantify
3. **Terminal Lucidity:** Rare, hard to study prospectively
4. **Savants:** Small sample sizes

### 5.5.2 Mitigation

| Limitation | Mitigation |
|------------|------------|
| Self-report bias | Focus on veridical, verifiable aspects |
| Timing uncertainty | Use prospective studies with monitoring |
| Rarity | Compile multiple case studies |
| Small samples | Look for consistent patterns |

## 5.6 Backend Integration Methodology

### 5.6.1 Mapping Protocol

Each scientific finding is mapped to Backend Architecture:

```
SCIENTIFIC FINDING:
v
BACKEND EQUIVALENT:
v
STRUCTURAL CORRESPONDENCE:
v
CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT:
```

### 5.6.2 Validation Criteria

For Backend mapping to be valid:
1. Structural correspondence (not just metaphorical)
2. Predictive power (Backend model predicted this)
3. No contradictions with other validated mappings
