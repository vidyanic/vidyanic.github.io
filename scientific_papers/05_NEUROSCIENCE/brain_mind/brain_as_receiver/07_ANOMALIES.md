# 7. Anomalies & Glitches

> **📖 Key Terms:** See [Dictionary](../../../00_META/DICTIONARY.md)

## 7.1 Veridical NDE Perceptions

### 7.1.1 The Phenomenon

Some NDE experiencers report accurate perceptions of events that occurred while they were clinically dead.

**Cases:**

| Case | Perception | Verification |
|------|-----------|--------------|
| Pam Reynolds | Surgical instruments described | Confirmed by surgeon |
| AWARE Patient 10 | CPR events from ceiling | Confirmed by staff |
| Maria (Seattle) | Tennis shoe on ledge | Found on ledge |

### 7.1.2 The Anomaly

```
GENERATOR MODEL CANNOT EXPLAIN:
═══════════════════════════════

1. Brain offline → No perception possible
2. Eyes closed/covered → No visual input
3. Specific details → Cannot be confabulation
4. Verifiable accuracy → Not guess or dream

HOW CAN BRAIN PERCEIVE WHEN NOT FUNCTIONING?
```

### 7.1.3 Receiver Model Explanation

```
RECEIVER EXPLANATION:
════════════════════

• Consciousness (Purusha/पुरुष) is non-local
• Brain is normally the INTERFACE for perception
• When brain offline, consciousness can perceive DIRECTLY
• No filtering = Access to non-local information
• Like receiver off, but tuning into signal directly
```

## 7.2 Acquired Savant Syndrome

### 7.2.1 The Phenomenon

People develop extraordinary abilities AFTER brain injury — not before.

**Derek Amato Case:**
- Shallow dive, hit head on pool bottom
- Severe concussion, memory problems
- Sat at piano (never played) → Performed like virtuoso
- Sees "black and white squares" in visual field
- Composes music without training

### 7.2.2 The Anomaly

```
GENERATOR MODEL CANNOT EXPLAIN:
═══════════════════════════════

1. Damage should REDUCE ability
2. Ability not learned → Where did it come from?
3. Access to information not previously available
4. Consistent pattern: Damage → Revealed ability
```

### 7.2.3 Receiver Model Explanation

```
RECEIVER EXPLANATION:
════════════════════

• Brain normally FILTERS access to information
• Damage to filter = More information flows through
• Musical patterns exist in consciousness field
• Injury removed barrier to access
• Not creation of new ability — REVELATION of access
```

## 7.3 Shared Death Experiences

### 7.3.1 The Phenomenon

People present at a death sometimes share the dying person's experience:
- See the same light
- Experience life review with them
- Encounter deceased relatives (who they don't know)

### 7.3.2 The Anomaly

```
GENERATOR MODEL CANNOT EXPLAIN:
═══════════════════════════════

1. How can TWO brains share ONE experience?
2. How can witness see deceased they never knew?
3. How can non-dying brain have dying experience?
```

### 7.3.3 Receiver Model Explanation

```
RECEIVER EXPLANATION:
════════════════════

• Consciousness field is shared (Brahman/ब्रह्मन्)
• Individual brains tune to this field
• At death, filter dissolves
• Nearby "receivers" can pick up the same experience
• Like two radios tuning to same frequency
```

## 7.4 Blind People Seeing in NDEs

### 7.4.1 The Phenomenon

People blind from birth report VISUAL experiences during NDEs:
- Colors never seen before
- Visual recognition of objects
- Accurate descriptions of environment

### 7.4.2 Ring & Cooper Study (1999)

Studied 31 blind individuals with NDEs:
- 80% reported some visual perception
- 50% reported detailed visual experience
- Descriptions matched actual environment

### 7.4.3 The Anomaly

```
GENERATOR MODEL CANNOT EXPLAIN:
═══════════════════════════════

1. No visual cortex experience → How visual content?
2. Never learned visual concepts → How visual categories?
3. Accurate visual details → Not imagination
```

### 7.4.4 Receiver Model Explanation

```
RECEIVER EXPLANATION:
════════════════════

• Vision is one MODALITY of consciousness
• Normally requires visual cortex to interface
• Without body, consciousness accesses directly
• Visual information available in consciousness field
• Blindness = Body filter; NDE = Body filter removed
```

## 7.5 Mindsight (Remote Viewing) in NDEs

### 7.5.1 The Phenomenon

NDE experiencers report perceiving events:
- In other rooms
- At distant locations
- Involving people they couldn't physically see

### 7.5.2 Cases

| Case | Perception | Distance | Verified |
|------|-----------|----------|----------|
| Various NDEs | Family in waiting room | Different floor | Yes |
| Various NDEs | Car accident site | Miles away | Some cases |

### 7.5.3 The Anomaly

```
GENERATOR MODEL:
Cannot explain any perception outside brain's location

RECEIVER MODEL:
Consciousness non-local; body is the localizer
Without body, consciousness not bound to location
```

---

## 7.6 Summary of Anomalies

| Anomaly | Generator Model | Receiver Model |
|---------|-----------------|----------------|
| Veridical NDEs | Cannot explain | Non-local consciousness |
| Acquired savants | Damage = Less ability (fails) | Damage = Less filtering ✓ |
| Shared death | Two brains, one experience? | Shared field ✓ |
| Blind seeing | No visual cortex experience? | Direct consciousness access ✓ |
| Remote perception | Impossible | Non-local consciousness ✓ |

**Pattern:** Every anomaly is explained by the receiver model, unexplained by the generator model.

## 7.7 Backend Perspective on Anomalies

### 7.7.1 Why Anomalies Occur

```
BACKEND FRAMEWORK:
══════════════════

Normal state:
• Atman (consciousness) identified with body
• Antahkarana (filter) active
• Experience localized, limited

Anomalous state:
• Atman less identified with body
• Antahkarana weakened/bypassed
• Access to non-local consciousness possible
• "Anomalies" are glimpses of unfiltered state
```

### 7.7.2 Siddhis as Systematic Anomalies

> **🔗 See:** [Siddhis — Consciousness Abilities](../../../../vishnu_engine/spec/backend/moksha/EXIT_PROTOCOLS.md)

Backend documentation describes systematic cultivation of these "anomalous" abilities through:
- Meditation (reducing filter)
- Pranayama (energy cultivation)
- Samadhi (filter dissolution)

What science calls "anomalies" may be normal capabilities when filter is reduced.
