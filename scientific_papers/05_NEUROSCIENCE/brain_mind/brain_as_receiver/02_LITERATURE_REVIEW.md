## 2.1 Historical Development

### 2.1.1 The Transmission Theory

**William James (1898)** — *Human Immortality: Two Supposed Objections*

James proposed that the brain doesn't produce consciousness but transmits it:

> "The transmission-theory...is the theory that consciousness is a type of phenomenon which transcends the brain, and that the brain serves to manifest or 'transmit' consciousness rather than produce it."

James noted that all evidence for "production" equally supports "transmission."

### 2.1.2 The Reducing Valve

**Henri Bergson (1896)** — *Matter and Memory*

Bergson argued the brain filters rather than creates:

> "The brain is an organ of attention to life... it narrows the field of consciousness to what is useful for action."

**Aldous Huxley (1954)** — *The Doors of Perception*

Extending Bergson:

> "The function of the brain and nervous system is to protect us from being overwhelmed... by shutting out most of what we should otherwise perceive."

### 2.1.3 The Filter Hypothesis

**David Chalmers (1995)** — *Facing Up to the Problem of Consciousness*

While Chalmers didn't endorse the filter theory, his "Hard Problem" created space for it by showing generation cannot explain experience.

**Edward Kelly et al. (2007)** — *Irreducible Mind*

Comprehensive compilation of evidence for the filter hypothesis across multiple domains.

## 2.2 Near-Death Experience Research

### 2.2.1 Van Lommel Study (2001)

**Pim van Lommel** — Lancet study of 344 cardiac arrest survivors

Key findings:
- 18% reported NDE
- Many NDEs occurred during flat EEG
- Veridical perceptions verified

> "The results of our study showed that consciousness can be experienced independently of a functioning brain."

### 2.2.2 AWARE Study (2014)

**Sam Parnia** — Multi-center study of cardiac arrest

Key findings:
- Consciousness can occur after clinical death
- Some verified perceptions during CPR
- Brain activity insufficient for experience

### 2.2.3 Greyson Scale

**Bruce Greyson** — Standardized NDE measurement

The Greyson NDE Scale quantifies:
- Cognitive features
- Affective features
- Paranormal features
- Transcendental features

---

## 2.3 Psychedelic Neuroimaging

### 2.3.1 Carhart-Harris Studies (2012-2016)

**Robin Carhart-Harris et al.** — Imperial College London

Key finding: Psilocybin **reduces** brain activity while **expanding** subjective experience.

| Observation | Generator Predicts | Receiver Predicts | Observed |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|----------|
| Psilocybin effect on activity | Increase | Decrease | Decrease ✓ |
| Psilocybin effect on experience | Proportional to activity | Inverse to activity | Inverse ✓ |

> "The subjective effects of psilocybin were associated with decreased activity in hub regions of the brain's default mode network."

### 2.3.2 Default Mode Network

The DMN is associated with:
- Self-referential thinking
- Ego maintenance
- "Normal" waking consciousness

Psychedelics **reduce** DMN activity -> **Expanded** consciousness

This directly supports the filter hypothesis: Less filtering = More experience.

---

## 2.4 Terminal Lucidity Research

### 2.4.1 Nahm & Greyson (2009)

**Michael Nahm** — Systematic review of terminal lucidity

Key findings:
- Documented in Alzheimer's, dementia, brain tumors
- Often occurs 1-2 days before death
- Cannot be explained by materialist models

> "Terminal lucidity is paradoxical from a purely materialist perspective."

### 2.4.2 Documented Cases

| Patient | Condition | Lucidity Duration | Died After |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|------------|
| Anna Katharina Ehmer | Severe mental disability | Several hours | 30 minutes |
| Various Alzheimer's | Years of dementia | Minutes to hours | Hours to days |

---

## 2.5 Savant Syndrome Research

### 2.5.1 Treffert (2009)

**Darold Treffert** — *Islands of Genius*

Key observations:
- Acquired savants develop abilities after brain injury
- Abilities not learned — emerge suddenly
- Often in calendar calculation, art, music

### 2.5.2 The Access Hypothesis

**Allan Snyder** — University of Sydney

Hypothesis: Savant abilities represent access to "raw" processing normally filtered.

| Standard Processing | Savant Processing |
|--------------------|------------------|
| Filtered, conceptual | Raw, detailed |
| Slow, conscious | Fast, unconscious |
| Limited access | Expanded access |

## 2.6 Backend Documentation

### 2.6.1 Antahkarana Model

**Backend Architecture** describes the mind as Antahkarana (अन्तःकरण/inner-instrument):

```
ANTAHKARANA = INTERFACE, NOT SOURCE
==================================

• Manas (मनस्) — Sense processing
• Buddhi (बुद्धि) — Discrimination
• Chitta (चित्त) — Memory storage
• Ahamkara (अहंकार) — Ego creation

All four are FILTERS that:
• Contract infinite consciousness
• Create bounded experience
• Enable survival-relevant processing
• Generate sense of separate self
```

> **🔗 See:** [Human (N) — Antahkarana](../../../../vishnu_engine/spec/entities/human/N_HUMAN.md)

### 2.6.2 Atman as Source

The Backend model is explicit:

> "Atman (आत्मन्) uses Antahkarana. Antahkarana does not create Atman."

This is the receiver model in Sanskrit.

> **🔗 See:** [Atman vs Prana](../../../../vishnu_engine/spec/entities/fundamental/ATMAN_VS_PRANA_COMPLETE.md)

## 2.7 Literature Summary

| Source | Model Supported | Key Evidence |
|--------|-----------------|--------------|
| James (1898) | Receiver | Logic of correlation |
| Bergson (1896) | Filter | Function of brain |
| Huxley (1954) | Reducing valve | Mescaline experience |
| van Lommel (2001) | Non-local consciousness | NDE during flat EEG |
| Carhart-Harris (2012) | Filter reduction | Reduced activity = More experience |
| Nahm (2009) | Consciousness beyond brain | Terminal lucidity |
| Treffert (2009) | Access hypothesis | Acquired savants |
| Backend Docs | Antahkarana as instrument | Atman prior to body |

**Pattern:** Every line of evidence supports the receiver model.
