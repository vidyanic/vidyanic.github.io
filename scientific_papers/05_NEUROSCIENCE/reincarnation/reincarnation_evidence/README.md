## 🔴 THE GLITCH

Kids under 7 sometimes:
- **Describe specific past lives** with verifiable details
- **Have birthmarks** matching past-life death wounds
- **Recognize strangers** as past-life family members
- **Speak languages** they were never taught
- **Display skills** they never learned in this life

This has been studied scientifically for 60+ years.

## ❓ Q&A — The Mind-Bending Questions

### "Is there actual evidence for reincarnation?"

Yes. Dr. Ian Stevenson (UVA) documented **3,000+ cases** of children with past-life memories. His methodology was rigorous:
- Interview child before any investigation
- Independently verify claims
- Rule out normal explanations
- Document physical evidence (birthmarks)

Many cases have **verified details** the child couldn't have known normally.

### "Give me an example."

**James Leininger (USA):**
- Age 2: Started having nightmares about plane crash
- Named himself "James" from past life, said plane was Corsair
- Named aircraft carrier: "Natoma Bay"
- Named co-pilot: "Jack Larsen"
- All verified: James Huston Jr., WW2 pilot, died exactly as described

**Ryan Hammons (USA):**
- Age 4: Described being a Hollywood agent
- Pointed to photo and said "That's me"
- Described house, career, death details
- All verified: Marty Martyn, Hollywood agent (55 verified facts)

### "Why do kids remember more than adults?"

**Brain plasticity theory:** Young brains haven't fully "formatted" with new identity. Past-life data is still accessible.

**Backend model:** The new avatar's memory hardware hasn't fully overwritten Jiva's stored data. By age 7, overwrite is mostly complete.

### "Why don't we all remember?"

Most past-life memory is stored as **Samskaras** (unconscious patterns) rather than explicit memories:
- Inexplicable phobias (past-life trauma)
- Natural talents (past-life skills)
- Strong attractions/aversions to places, people
- "Old soul" feeling

Full memory would be overwhelming and would interfere with this life's lessons.

## 🎮 THE GAME ANALOGY

```
NEW GAME PLUS:
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Start new game with different character       │
│  But: Some achievements carry over             │
│  Some skills unlocked from start               │
│  Déjà vu in certain locations                  │
│  Sometimes glitched memories of old save       │
│                                                │
│  Young save = Old data still accessible        │
│  Older save = New game overwrites old data     │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

REINCARNATION:
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  New incarnation with different body           │
│  But: Some karma carries over                  │
│  Some talents present from birth               │
│  Strange familiarity with places/people        │
│  Sometimes direct past-life memories           │
│                                                │
│  Young child = Jiva data still accessible      │
│  Older child = New brain overwrites memories   │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

## 🎯 KEY INSIGHT

> **Science:** "Some children have verified memories of deceased strangers' lives"  
> **Translation:** "The player (Jiva) continues across avatars"  
> **Backend Term:** Punarjanma (पुनर्जन्म/rebirth)

Thousands of documented cases. Rigorous methodology. Verified facts.

You've done this before.

## ⚡ WHY THIS MATTERS IN 2026

- **You're not new here** — this isn't your first run
- **Skills and phobias have history** — past-life origins
- **Death loses its sting** — you've survived every death so far
- **Dwapara remembering** — more access to past-life awareness

The fear of death is the fear of something that's already happened to you countless times.

You're still here.
