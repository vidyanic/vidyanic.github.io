## Research Question

Is there empirical evidence supporting reincarnation (Jiva continuity across lives)?

---

## Hypothesis

**H₁:** Documented cases of children with verified past-life memories provide evidence for Jiva continuity.

---

## Key Evidence

| Study Type | Cases | Findings |
|------------|-------|----------|
| Stevenson | 2,500+ | Verified memories, birthmarks |
| Tucker | 2,500+ | Continuation of Stevenson's work |
| Cross-cultural | Multiple | Pattern consistent globally |

---

## Verification Types

| Type | Evidence |
|------|----------|
| **Memories** | Specific names, places, events |
| **Birthmarks** | Matching previous death wounds |
| **Behaviors** | Phobias, skills unexplained by current life |
| **Recognition** | Identifying previous life's family/objects |

---

## Backend Correlation

| Evidence | Backend Mechanism |
|----------|-------------------|
| Memories | Samskara/Vasana carryover |
| Birthmarks | Karma imprint on new body |
| Phobias | Unresolved trauma Samskaras |
| Skills | Practiced abilities as Vasanas |

---

## Confidence Score

**75%** — Strong case studies, but empirical verification challenging.
