## 🎯 KEY QUESTION

**What really causes Alzheimer's disease, and why do current treatments fail?**

---

## 📋 QUICK ANSWERS

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| What is Alzheimer's? | Samskara Overload (संस्कार-अधिभार) — Cellular memory system crash |
| Root cause? | Accumulated unprocessed impressions (Samskaras) |
| Why memory loss? | System deletes recent to preserve ancient/core |
| Why no cure? | Treating plaque, not the overload |
| Prevention? | Regular Samskara processing (meditation, sleep, forgiveness) |

|   SAMSKARA (संस्कार):                                                    |
|   ===================                                                     |
|   • Mental impressions stored in Chitta (mind-field)                     |
|   • Every experience leaves an imprint                                    |
|   • Accumulate over lifetime (and lifetimes)                             |
|   • Modern: Epigenetic marks + synaptic patterns                         |
|                                                                           |
|   NORMAL PROCESSING:                                                      |
|   ==================                                                      |
|   • Sleep consolidates and clears                                        |
|   • Meditation processes and releases                                    |
|   • Forgiveness dissolves emotional Samskaras                            |
|   • Death clears body-level Samskaras                                    |
|                                                                           |
|   OVERLOAD CONDITION:                                                     |
|   ===================                                                     |
|   • More accumulation than processing                                    |
|   • System becomes overwhelmed                                           |
|   • Emergency protocol: Delete recent to save core                       |
|   • Procedural memory preserved (oldest, deepest)                        |
|   • Episodic memory deleted first (newest)                               |
|                                                                           |
|   THIS IS EXACTLY THE ALZHEIMER'S MEMORY LOSS PATTERN                   |
|                                                                           |

*Alzheimer's isn't a brain disease — it's a memory system crash from too many unprocessed experiences. The brain is doing exactly what it should: protecting core identity by sacrificing recent.*
