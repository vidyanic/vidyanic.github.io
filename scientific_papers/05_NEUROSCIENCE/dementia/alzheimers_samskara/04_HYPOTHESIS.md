# 4. HYPOTHESIS

---

## 4.1 Primary Hypothesis

**H₀ (Null):** Alzheimer's is primarily caused by amyloid plaques and tau tangles, with memory loss being random neural degeneration.

**H₁ (Alternative):** Alzheimer's is Samskara Overload — the failure of memory processing/clearing systems leading to emergency deletion protocols that preserve core identity while sacrificing recent memories.

---

## 4.2 Sub-Hypotheses

### H1a: Memory Loss Pattern = Priority Deletion

```
CLAIM: Memory loss follows Samskara depth, not random loss

EVIDENCE TYPES:
✓ Recent memory lost first, procedural last
✓ Pattern consistent across patients
✓ Core identity preserved longest
```

### H1b: Processing Failure = Risk Factor

```
CLAIM: Impaired Samskara processing increases AD risk

EVIDENCE TYPES:
✓ Sleep deprivation = Major risk factor
✓ Chronic stress = Risk factor
✓ Glymphatic dysfunction in AD
```

### H1c: Enhanced Processing = Protection

```
CLAIM: Better Samskara processing = Lower AD risk

EVIDENCE TYPES:
✓ Meditation associated with preserved memory
✓ Good sleep = Lower risk
✓ Active lifestyle = Lower risk
```

### H1d: Plaques = Byproduct, Not Cause

```
CLAIM: Amyloid is consequence of overload, not cause

EVIDENCE TYPES:
✓ Amyloid present in normal elderly
✓ Removing plaques doesn't restore memory
✓ Amyloid may be protective response
```

## 4.3 Testable Predictions

| # | Prediction | Test | Status |
|---|------------|------|--------|
| 1 | Memory loss follows depth pattern | Clinical observation | ✓ Confirmed |
| 2 | Sleep quality inversely related to AD | Epidemiology | ✓ Confirmed |
| 3 | Meditation reduces risk | Longitudinal studies | Partial |
| 4 | Procedural memory preserved longest | Clinical | ✓ Confirmed |
| 5 | Glymphatic function impaired in AD | Imaging | ✓ Confirmed |
| 6 | Plaque removal doesn't restore memory | Clinical trials | ✓ Confirmed |

## 4.4 Falsification Criteria

The hypothesis would be **falsified** if:

1. ❌ Memory loss is random, not patterned
2. ❌ Sleep has no relation to AD risk
3. ❌ Procedural memory lost early
4. ❌ Plaque removal restores memory
5. ❌ Core identity lost before other memories
