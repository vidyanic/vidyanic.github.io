# 7. ANOMALIES & EDGE CASES

---

## 7.1 Early-Onset Alzheimer's

### 7.1.1 The Question

How does the model explain early-onset AD (before 65)?

### 7.1.2 Resolution

```
EARLY-ONSET FACTORS:
===================

1. GENETIC PREDISPOSITION
   • Faster Samskara accumulation rate
   • Impaired clearing from birth
   • Lower threshold for overload

2. INTENSE LIFE STRESS
   • More production than processing capacity
   • Earlier overload despite younger age

3. PROCESSING IMPAIRMENT (Innate)
   • Glymphatic defects from genetics
   • Sleep disorders from early life

Age is not the only factor — it's ACCUMULATION vs PROCESSING.
Earlier overload = Earlier symptoms.
```

## 7.2 Genetic Factors (APOE4)

### 7.2.1 The Question

How does genetics fit the Samskara model?

### 7.2.2 Resolution

```
APOE4 AND SAMSKARA:
===================

APOE4 carriers have:
• Impaired lipid metabolism (affects synapses)
• Reduced glymphatic clearance
• Higher amyloid accumulation

IN SAMSKARA TERMS:
• Slower Samskara clearing
• Lower capacity for processing
• Reaches overload threshold earlier

Genetics set the CAPACITY.
Lifestyle determines the LOAD.
Both matter.

## 7.3 Inconsistent Memory Moments

### 7.3.1 The Question

Why do AD patients have "lucid moments" with sudden memory clarity?

### 7.3.2 Resolution

```
LUCID MOMENTS EXPLAINED:
========================

The Samskaras are not DESTROYED:
• They're INACCESSIBLE (locked)
• Under certain conditions, access can temporarily restore

CONDITIONS FOR LUCIDITY:
• Deep emotional connection (music, loved ones)
• Reduced stress (lowered overload pressure)
• Circadian peak (better processing time)

The filing cabinet is locked, not burned.
Sometimes the key appears briefly.
```

## 7.4 Why Not Everyone?

### 7.4.1 The Question

If everyone accumulates Samskaras, why doesn't everyone get AD?

### 7.4.2 Resolution

```
THE THRESHOLD VARIES:
====================

FACTORS DETERMINING THRESHOLD:
• Genetic capacity (processing efficiency)
• Lifestyle (processing habits)
• Stress levels (production rate)
• Sleep quality (clearing rate)
• Meditation/mindfulness (active processing)
• Diet, exercise (brain health)

Many people die before reaching THEIR threshold.
Some never reach it due to excellent processing.
Some reach it early due to poor processing + high load.
```

## 7.5 Rapid vs Slow Progression

### 7.5.1 The Question

Why does AD progress at different rates?

### 7.5.2 Resolution

```
PROGRESSION RATE FACTORS:
=========================

FASTER PROGRESSION:
• Continued high stress
• Poor sleep
• No compensatory practices
• Worse genetics

SLOWER PROGRESSION:
• Reduced stress
• Improved sleep
• Meditation/mindfulness
• Supportive environment
• Better genetics

The rate depends on whether overload INCREASES or STABILIZES.
```

## 7.6 Medication Benefits

### 7.6.1 The Question

Why do cholinesterase inhibitors help (somewhat)?

### 7.6.2 Resolution

```
MEDICATION MECHANISM (Samskara View):
=====================================

Cholinesterase inhibitors:
• Increase acetylcholine availability
• Enhance remaining synaptic function
• DON'T address the overload

This is like:
• Turning up the volume on a failing speaker
• Doesn't fix the speaker, just amplifies what's left
• Eventually fails as system continues to degrade

They provide TEMPORARY COMPENSATION, not cure.

## 7.7 Anomaly Impact Assessment

| Anomaly | Severity | Resolution | Impact |
|---------|----------|------------|--------|
| Early-onset | Medium | Threshold varies | -2% |
| Genetics | Medium | Sets capacity | -2% |
| Lucid moments | Low | Access, not loss | 0% |
| Not universal | Low | Threshold model | -1% |
| Variable rate | Low | Load vs processing | -1% |
| Medication | Medium | Compensation, not cure | -3% |

**Net impact: -9%**
**Adjusted confidence: 100% -> 91%**
