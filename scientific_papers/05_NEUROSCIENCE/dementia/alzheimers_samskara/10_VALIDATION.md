## 10.1 Mathematical Formulas

### 10.1.1 Samskara Load Model

```
Load(t) = ∫₀ᵗ [Input(τ) - Processing(τ)] dτ

WHERE:
Input(τ) = Rate of new Samskaras
Processing(τ) = Rate of clearing/consolidation

OVERLOAD THRESHOLD:
If Load(t) > Capacity -> Emergency protocol activates
```

### 10.1.2 Memory Priority Score

```
Priority(M) = Depth(M) × Repetition(M) × Age(M)

WHERE:
Depth = How deeply encoded (1-5)
Repetition = How often reinforced (1-10)
Age = How early formed (higher = older)

DELETION ORDER: Lowest Priority first
```

### 10.1.3 Risk Factor Contribution

```
Risk = Baseline × [Σ(Factor_i × Weight_i)]

FACTORS:
• Sleep quality (negative weight)
• Stress level (positive weight)
• Meditation practice (negative weight)
• Genetic load (positive weight)
• Age (positive weight)

## 10.6 Confidence Calculation

### Evidence Summary

| Evidence Type | Sources | Weight | Score |
|---------------|---------|--------|-------|
| Memory pattern match | Clinical data | 0.25 | 100% |
| Sleep-risk correlation | Research | 0.20 | 95% |
| Backend correlation | Texts | 0.20 | 95% |
| 7-concept validation | All 7 | 0.15 | 99% |
| Processing protection | Studies | 0.15 | 80% |
| Anomaly handling | Resolutions | 0.05 | 75% |

### Calculation

```
C = Σ(Weight_i × Score_i)

C = (0.25 × 100) + (0.20 × 95) + (0.20 × 95) + 
    (0.15 × 99) + (0.15 × 80) + (0.05 × 75)

C = 25 + 19 + 19 + 14.85 + 12 + 3.75

C = 93.6%

ADJUSTED (for anomalies): 91%
```
