## 5.1 Approach Overview

```
METHODOLOGY:
============

1. MEMORY PATTERN ANALYSIS
   Map AD memory loss to Samskara depth model

2. RISK FACTOR CORRELATION
   Match processing failures with AD risk

3. GLYMPHATIC RESEARCH REVIEW
   Connect sleep clearing with Samskara clearing

4. MEDITATION LITERATURE REVIEW
   Assess protective effects

5. 7-CONCEPT VALIDATION
   Apply standard validation stack
```

## 5.2 Memory Pattern Analysis

### 5.2.1 Classification

| Memory Type | Samskara Depth | Expected Loss Order |
|-------------|----------------|---------------------|
| Immediate (seconds) | None (working memory) | Preserved initially |
| Recent episodic | Level 1-2 | 1st to go |
| Remote episodic | Level 2-3 | 2nd to go |
| Semantic | Level 3 | 3rd to go |
| Procedural | Level 4 | 4th to go (last) |
| Core identity | Level 5 | Preserved longest |

### 5.2.2 Assessment Tools

| Tool | Measures |
|------|----------|
| MMSE | General cognition |
| Episodic memory tests | Recent vs remote |
| Semantic fluency | Word/category knowledge |
| Procedural tests | Motor skills |
| Orientation | Identity awareness |

## 5.3 Risk Factor Analysis

### 5.3.1 Processing Impairment Factors

| Factor | Processing Impact | Expected AD Risk |
|--------|-------------------|------------------|
| Poor sleep | Reduced clearing | Increased |
| Chronic stress | Excess production | Increased |
| No meditation | No active processing | Increased |
| Depression | Stuck negative patterns | Increased |
| Sedentary | Reduced circulation | Increased |

### 5.3.2 Data Sources

- Epidemiological studies
- Meta-analyses
- Longitudinal cohorts
- Case-control studies

## 5.4 Glymphatic Correlation

### 5.4.1 Parameters

| Glymphatic Factor | Measurement | AD Correlation |
|-------------------|-------------|----------------|
| Sleep quality | PSG/actigraphy | Inverse |
| Deep sleep % | PSG | Inverse |
| CSF flow | MRI | Reduced in AD |
| Waste clearance | Imaging | Reduced in AD |

### 5.4.2 Mapping

```
GLYMPHATIC = SAMSKARA CLEARING:
===============================

Glymphatic active -> Waste cleared -> Samskaras processed
Glymphatic impaired -> Waste accumulates -> Samskaras overload

PREDICTION: Glymphatic function inversely correlates with AD
```

## 5.5 7-Concept Validation

| Concept | Test Question | Expected |
|---------|---------------|----------|
| Conservation | Memory energy conserved? | Yes (redistributed) |
| Entropy | Disorder increases? | Yes (memory entropy) |
| Fractal | Same pattern at scales? | Yes (synaptic to system) |
| Karma | Action-consequence? | Yes (lifestyle -> risk) |
| Observer | Awareness affects? | Yes (preserved longest) |
| Cycles | Cyclical patterns? | Yes (circadian, progression) |
| Gunas | Classifiable? | Yes (Tamas dominates in AD) |
