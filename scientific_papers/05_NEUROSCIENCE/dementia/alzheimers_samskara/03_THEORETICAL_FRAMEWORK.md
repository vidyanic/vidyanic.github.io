# 3. THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK

## 3.1 The Samskara-Memory Model

### 3.1.1 Core Concept

```
SAMSKARA = MEMORY IMPRINT
=========================

Every experience creates:
1. NEURAL TRACE — Synaptic connections
2. EPIGENETIC MARK — DNA methylation, histone changes
3. CHITTA IMPRESSION — Subtle mind-field pattern

All three are SAMSKARA at different levels:
• Gross (Sthula) = Neural
• Subtle (Sukshma) = Epigenetic
• Causal (Karana) = Chitta
```

### 3.1.2 Samskara Depth Model

```
SAMSKARA DEPTH = f(Age_of_formation, Repetition, Emotional_intensity)

DEPTH LEVELS:
=============

Level 1: SURFACE (Recent, one-time, low emotion)
• Yesterday's breakfast
• Casual conversation
• Easily overwritten

Level 2: SHALLOW (Weeks-months, some repetition)
• Recent project details
• New acquaintance names
• Relatively erasable

Level 3: MEDIUM (Years, repeated, emotional)
• Career knowledge
• Semantic facts
• More stable

Level 4: DEEP (Childhood, heavily reinforced)
• Procedural skills
• Core personality
• Very stable

Level 5: CORE (Primordial, Atman-connected)
• Sense of "I"
• Basic existence
• Never lost (Atman itself)
```

## 3.2 Normal Samskara Processing

### 3.2.1 Processing Mechanisms

| Mechanism | Function | Backend Term |
|-----------|----------|--------------|
| Sleep | Consolidation + clearing | Nidra (निद्रा) |
| Meditation | Active processing + release | Dhyana (ध्यान) |
| Dreaming | Emotional processing | Swapna (स्वप्न) |
| Forgiveness | Dissolving negative charge | Kshama (क्षमा) |
| Natural forgetting | Routine clearing | Smriti-kshaya |

### 3.2.2 The Daily Cycle

```
HEALTHY SAMSKARA PROCESSING:
============================

WAKING (Jagrat):
• New Samskaras formed
• Input > Processing

SLEEP (Nidra):
• Glymphatic clearing active
• Consolidation of important
• Deletion of trivial
• Processing > Input

BALANCE: Input ≈ Processing
RESULT: Stable memory, clear mind
```

## 3.3 Samskara Overload

### 3.3.1 Causes of Overload

| Cause | Mechanism |
|-------|-----------|
| Poor sleep | Reduced clearing |
| Chronic stress | Excess production |
| Trauma (unprocessed) | Stuck Samskaras |
| No meditation | No active processing |
| Aging | Slower clearing |
| Information overload | Excess input |

### 3.3.2 The Overload Sequence

```
STAGE 1: ACCUMULATION
=====================
• Input consistently exceeds processing
• Backlog builds
• Mild forgetfulness begins

STAGE 2: STRESS
===============
• System under strain
• Compensation mechanisms activate
• Short-term memory affected

STAGE 3: OVERLOAD
=================
• Critical threshold exceeded
• Emergency protocol activates
• Priority-based deletion begins

STAGE 4: MANAGED DECLINE
========================
• Systematic deletion newest to oldest
• Core functions preserved
• Identity maintained as long as possible
```

## 3.4 The Emergency Protocol

### 3.4.1 Priority System

```
WHEN OVERLOADED, DELETE IN ORDER:
=================================

1. Recent episodic (newest, least integrated)
2. Remote episodic (older, more integrated)
3. Semantic (deeply encoded)
4. Procedural (earliest, most practiced)
5. Core identity (Atman — never deleted)

THIS IS EXACTLY THE ALZHEIMER'S PATTERN.
```

### 3.4.2 Why This Order?

| Memory Type | Why Preserved/Deleted |
|-------------|----------------------|
| Recent episodic | Least essential, most dispensable |
| Procedural | Essential for survival, heavily reinforced |
| Core identity | Connected to Atman, permanent |

**The brain is INTELLIGENT. It protects what matters most.**

## 3.5 Scientific Correlates

### 3.5.1 Mapping to Neuroscience

| Samskara Concept | Neuroscience Correlate |
|------------------|----------------------|
| Samskara formation | Long-term potentiation |
| Samskara depth | Consolidation degree |
| Processing | Sleep-dependent consolidation |
| Clearing | Glymphatic system |
| Overload | Synaptic dysfunction |
| Emergency protocol | Selective synaptic pruning |

### 3.5.2 The Glymphatic Connection

```
GLYMPHATIC FUNCTION = SAMSKARA CLEARING:
========================================

• Clears metabolic waste (including amyloid)
• Most active during deep sleep
• Reduced in aging
• Impaired in AD risk factors

Glymphatic failure = Samskara overload trigger
```
