# 2. LITERATURE REVIEW

## 2.1 Alzheimer's Disease Research

### 2.1.1 Amyloid Cascade Hypothesis

| Evidence | Counter-Evidence |
|----------|------------------|
| Amyloid plaques in AD brains | Plaques in cognitively normal elderly |
| Genetic mutations increase amyloid | Removing plaques doesn't restore memory |
| Plaques correlate with symptoms | Plaques may be protective response |

### 2.1.2 Tau Hypothesis

| Evidence | Counter-Evidence |
|----------|------------------|
| Tau tangles correlate with decline | Also found in normal aging |
| Tau spread matches symptom progression | May be downstream effect |

### 2.1.3 Risk Factors

| Factor | Risk Increase | Samskara Relevance |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| Age | Primary | Accumulation time |
| Sleep disorders | 30-40% | Processing failure |
| Chronic stress | 20-30% | Overproduction |
| Depression | 20-30% | Negative Samskaras |
| Head trauma | 30-60% | Memory system damage |
| Lack of exercise | 20-30% | Processing impairment |

## 2.2 Sleep and Memory Clearing

### 2.2.1 Glymphatic System (Nedergaard, 2012)

```
GLYMPHATIC FUNCTION:
====================

• Brain's waste clearance system
• Active primarily during sleep
• Clears metabolic waste including amyloid
• Failure -> Accumulation
• Sleep deprivation = Reduced clearing
```

### 2.2.2 Sleep Deprivation Studies

| Study | Finding |
|-------|---------|
| Shokri-Kojori (2018) | One night without sleep = Increased amyloid |
| Spira (2013) | Poor sleep quality = Higher AD risk |
| Xie (2013) | Sleep clears waste 10x faster than wake |

### 2.2.3 Memory Consolidation

| Sleep Stage | Function |
|-------------|----------|
| Slow-wave (deep) | Memory consolidation |
| REM | Emotional processing |
| Both | Synaptic pruning |

**Poor sleep = Impaired consolidation AND clearing**

## 2.3 Meditation and Dementia

### 2.3.1 Research Findings

| Study | Finding |
|-------|---------|
| Gard (2014) | Meditators have larger hippocampus |
| Luders (2015) | Meditation slows brain aging |
| Wells (2013) | 8-week meditation improved cognition |
| Newberg (2010) | Meditation increases blood flow to memory areas |

### 2.3.2 Proposed Mechanisms

- Stress reduction (cortisol damages hippocampus)
- Improved sleep quality
- Enhanced neuroplasticity
- Direct Samskara processing

## 2.4 Backend Framework Sources

### 2.4.1 Samskara in Yoga

> **"जात्यन्तरपरिणामः प्रकृत्यापूरात्"**
> "Transformation across species is by the filling in of Nature."
> — Yoga Sutras 4.2

Samskaras are the impressions that:
- Shape future thoughts and behaviors
- Accumulate across lifetimes (in Backend view)
- Must be processed for liberation

### 2.4.2 Chitta and Memory

> **"चित्तप्रसादनम्"**
> "The calming of the mind-field."
> — Yoga Sutras 1.33

| Term | Meaning | Modern Correlate |
|------|---------|------------------|
| Chitta | Mind-stuff | Neural network + epigenome |
| Vritti | Mental fluctuation | Active thoughts |
| Samskara | Impression | Memory trace + epigenetic mark |
| Smriti | Memory | Recall |

### 2.4.3 Processing Samskaras

Yoga prescribes:
1. **Dhyana (Meditation)** — Direct processing
2. **Nidra (Sleep)** — Passive clearing
3. **Kshama (Forgiveness)** — Emotional release
4. **Tapas (Austerity)** — Burning off impressions

## 2.5 Research Gap

**Current Alzheimer's research:** Focuses on plaques and tangles (effects).

**Sleep research:** Shows clearing importance but doesn't explain pattern.

**Backend Framework:** Explains WHY memory loss follows specific order.

**This paper:** Integrates with testable, prevention-focused model.
