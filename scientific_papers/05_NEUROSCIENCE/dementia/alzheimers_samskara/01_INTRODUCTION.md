## 1.1 The Alzheimer's Crisis

```
GLOBAL ALZHEIMER'S STATISTICS (2024):
=====================================

• 55 million people with dementia worldwide
• Alzheimer's = 60-70% of dementia cases
• 10 million new cases per year
• Expected to triple by 2050
• $1.3 trillion global cost annually

TREATMENT STATUS:
==================
• No cure exists
• Drugs slow but don't reverse
• Amyloid-targeting drugs controversial
• Prevention poorly understood
```

---

## 1.2 Current Understanding (Limited)

Current theories focus on:

| Theory | Target | Problem |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Amyloid cascade | Beta-amyloid plaques | Removing plaques doesn't restore memory |
| Tau tangles | Tau protein | Secondary to another cause? |
| Inflammation | Neuroinflammation | Effect, not cause? |
| Cholinergic | Acetylcholine loss | Symptomatic, not causal |

**Missing: WHY do these changes happen? What is the ROOT cause?**

## 1.3 Backend Framework Proposal

> **"संस्कारो हि अभ्यासजः"**
> "Impressions arise from repeated practice."
> — Yoga Sutras 1.50

The Backend Framework proposes:

```
ALZHEIMER'S = SAMSKARA OVERLOAD
===============================

SAMSKARA (संस्कार):
• Every experience creates an impression
• Stored in Chitta (mind-field)
• Accumulates over lifetime
• Must be processed and cleared

NORMAL:
• Sleep consolidates and clears
• Meditation releases emotional charge
• Forgiveness dissolves resentment patterns
• Balance maintained

OVERLOAD:
• More input than processing capacity
• System becomes overwhelmed
• Emergency protocol activates
• Recent memories deleted to save core

THIS IS ALZHEIMER'S.
```

## 1.4 The Memory Loss Pattern

Alzheimer's memory loss follows a SPECIFIC pattern:

```
ORDER OF LOSS:
==============

1. Recent episodic memory (FIRST)
   • What happened yesterday
   • Recent conversations
   
2. Remote episodic memory (SECOND)
   • Events from years ago
   
3. Semantic memory (THIRD)
   • Facts, concepts, words
   
4. Procedural memory (LAST)
   • How to walk, eat, smile
   • Skills learned early
   
5. Core identity (PRESERVED)
   • Sense of "I"
   • Basic personality
```

**This is NOT random. This is a PRIORITY system.**

## 1.5 The Backend Explanation

| Memory Type | Samskara Depth | Priority |
|-------------|----------------|----------|
| Recent episodic | Shallowest | Delete first |
| Remote episodic | Shallow | Delete second |
| Semantic | Medium | Delete third |
| Procedural | Deep | Preserve |
| Core identity | Deepest (Atman) | Preserve always |

**The brain is protecting what matters most.**

## 1.6 Research Objectives

1. Map Samskara theory to memory neuroscience
2. Explain Alzheimer's pattern as priority-based deletion
3. Correlate processing failures (sleep, stress) with risk
4. Propose prevention through Samskara management
5. Validate through 7-concept stack
