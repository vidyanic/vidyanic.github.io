|  CORE INSIGHT:                                              |
|  AD = Intelligent overload response, not random disease    |
|  Brain protects core identity by sacrificing recent        |

|  1. Recent episodic (newest, lowest priority)              |
|  2. Remote episodic                                         |
|  3. Semantic (facts)                                        |

|  PREVENTION:                                                |
|  • Sleep well (7-9 hrs, optimize deep)                     |
|  • Meditate daily (20+ min)                                |
|  • Reduce stress                                           |
|  • Exercise regularly                                       |
|  • Practice forgiveness                                     |
|  • Stay socially connected                                  |
