## Appendix A: Key Philosophical Arguments

### A.1 The Zombie Argument (Chalmers)

```
PREMISE 1:
Zombies are conceivable.
(A being physically identical to me but with no experience)

PREMISE 2:
If zombies are conceivable, zombies are metaphysically possible.

PREMISE 3:
If zombies are possible, consciousness is not identical to physical.

CONCLUSION:
Consciousness is not identical to physical processes.

RESPONSE TO OBJECTORS:
"Inconceivable" → But we can conceive it, so...
"Not really possible" → Possibility follows from conceivability for fundamental concepts
```

### A.2 The Knowledge Argument (Jackson)

```
SETUP:
Mary knows ALL physical facts about color.
Mary has never experienced color.
Mary sees red for the first time.

QUESTION:
Does Mary learn something new?

INTUITION:
Yes — she learns what red LOOKS LIKE.

CONCLUSION:
Physical facts don't capture experiential facts.
Therefore: There are non-physical facts (Anubhava/अनुभव — subjective experience-qualities).

JACKSON'S LATER REVISION:
Jackson later rejected this. But the argument stands independent of author.
```

### A.3 The Bat Argument (Nagel)

```
QUESTION:
What is it like to be a bat?

ANALYSIS:
Bats use echolocation.
We cannot imagine what this is like.
No amount of physical description tells us.

CONCLUSION:
There is a subjective fact about bat experience.
This fact is not captured by objective description.
Consciousness has an irreducibly subjective character.

## Appendix C: NDE Data Summary

### C.1 van Lommel Study (2001)

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Total patients | 344 |
| NDE reported | 62 (18%) |
| Deep NDE | 23 (7%) |
| Follow-up | 2 and 8 years |
| Life changes | Significant in NDE group |

### C.2 Common NDE Elements

| Element | Frequency |
|---------|-----------|
| Feeling of peace | 79% |
| Bright light | 62% |
| Deceased relatives | 32% |
| Out-of-body | 24% |
| Life review | 13% |
| Border/point of no return | 8% |

### C.3 Veridical Perceptions

Cases where NDE percipients reported accurate details from when they were clinically dead:
- Man saw where nurse put his dentures
- Woman described resuscitation details
- Blind individuals described visual scenes

## Appendix D: Terminal Lucidity Cases

### D.1 Case Categories (Nahm 2012)

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Type 1 | Gradual return over days |
| Type 2 | Sudden return hours before death |
| Type 3 | Unexpected, brief lucidity |

### D.2 Conditions Showing Terminal Lucidity

- Alzheimer's disease
- Schizophrenia
- Brain tumors
- Stroke damage
- Meningitis
- Abscess

**Common feature:** Brain damage that should prevent lucidity.

## Appendix E: Comparison of Models

### E.1 Generator vs. Receiver

| Aspect | Generator Model | Receiver Model |
|--------|-----------------|----------------|
| Consciousness source | Brain | External to brain |
| Brain function | Creates | Filters/receives |
| Damage effect | Less consciousness | Different filtering |
| Death effect | Ends consciousness | Removes filter |
| NDEs | Impossible or artifact | Expected |
| Terminal lucidity | Impossible | Expected |
| Psychedelic paradox | Unexplained | Expected |

### E.2 Evidence Fit

| Evidence | Generator | Receiver |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| NDE during flat EEG | ✗ | ✓ |
| Terminal lucidity | ✗ | ✓ |
| Psychedelic paradox | ✗ | ✓ |
| Acquired savants | ✗ | ✓ |
| Meditation effects | ~ | ✓ |
| Neural correlates | ✓ | ✓ |

**Receiver model explains more.**

## Appendix F: Logical Formalization

### F.1 The Axiom Proof (Formal)

```
LET:
C = Consciousness
E = Explanation
P = Presupposition

AXIOM 1:
∀x: E(x) → C exists (All explanation requires consciousness)

AXIOM 2:
E(C) → P(C) (Explaining consciousness presupposes consciousness)

THEOREM:
¬∃e: e = E(C) ∧ ¬P(C) (No explanation of C without presupposing C)

PROOF:
Assume ∃e: e = E(C) ∧ ¬P(C)
By Axiom 2: E(C) → P(C)
Therefore: E(C) → ¬(¬P(C))
Contradiction with assumption
Therefore: ¬∃e: e = E(C) ∧ ¬P(C)
QED

COROLLARY:
C is axiomatic (cannot be derived)
```

### F.2 The Receiver Inference (Formal)

```
LET:
B = Brain function level
C = Consciousness level
G(x,y) = x generates y
F(x,y) = x filters y

IF G(B,C):
dB/dt < 0 → dC/dt < 0 (less brain → less consciousness)

OBSERVATION:
∃ cases: dB/dt < 0 ∧ dC/dt > 0

CONTRADICTION:
Therefore: ¬G(B,C)

ALTERNATIVE:
F(B,C): dB/dt < 0 → (filter decreases → C access increases)
This fits observations.

CONCLUSION:
F(B,C) rather than G(B,C)
```

## Appendix G: Future Research Proposals

### G.1 NDE Verification Studies

**Proposal:** Place hidden targets in resuscitation rooms
**Method:** Test if NDE experiencers can identify targets
**Expected:** If consciousness leaves body, targets identifiable

### G.2 Terminal Lucidity Brain Imaging

**Proposal:** Real-time imaging during terminal lucidity
**Method:** Continuous EEG/fMRI in hospice settings
**Expected:** Lucidity without corresponding brain recovery

### G.3 Filter Mechanism Research

**Proposal:** Identify brain structures that correlate with consciousness restriction
**Method:** Compare meditators, psychedelic users, and controls
**Expected:** Identify "filter" circuits
