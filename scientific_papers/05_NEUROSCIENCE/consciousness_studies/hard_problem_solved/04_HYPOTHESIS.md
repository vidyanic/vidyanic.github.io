# 4. Hypothesis

## 4.1 Primary Hypothesis

> **H₀: Consciousness is a fundamental feature of reality, not derived from or produced by physical processes. The "Hard Problem" dissolves when this is recognized.**

This claims:
- Consciousness is axiomatic
- The brain-generation model is wrong
- The receiver model is correct
- The problem disappears with correct framing

---

## 4.2 Sub-Hypotheses

### H1: Materialism Fails

> **H1: All materialist attempts to explain consciousness (identity, emergence, functionalism) fail because they commit a category error.**

**Rationale:**
- No mechanism found after 50+ years
- Explanatory gap remains
- Logical arguments (zombies, knowledge) show flaws

**Testable Prediction:**
No materialist theory will successfully close the explanatory gap.

---

### H2: Consciousness is Axiomatic

> **H2: Consciousness cannot be explained because it is axiomatic — the starting point of all explanation.**

**Rationale:**
- All knowledge is known through consciousness
- You cannot step outside consciousness to explain it
- Axioms don't get explained — they explain

**Testable Prediction:**
Any attempt to explain consciousness will presuppose consciousness.

---

### H3: Brain Receives, Not Generates

> **H3: The brain is a receiver/filter of consciousness, not a generator of it.**

**Rationale:**
- NDEs show experience without brain activity
- Terminal lucidity shows clarity without healthy brain
- Damage sometimes enhances experience (reduced filtering)

**Testable Prediction:**
Anomalies will continue where brain dysfunction doesn't reduce experience.

---

### H4: Backend Framework is Accurate

> **H4: The Purusha-Prakriti model correctly describes the consciousness-matter relationship.**

**Rationale:**
- Purusha (consciousness) is described as primary
- Prakriti (matter) is described as secondary
- This matches the required inversion

**Testable Prediction:**
Backend framework will correctly predict consciousness phenomena.

---

## 4.3 Null Hypothesis

> **H_null: Consciousness is produced by the brain, and the Hard Problem will eventually be solved by neuroscience.**

**Requirements to Accept Null:**
1. Mechanism discovered that derives experience from non-experience
2. Explanatory gap closed with logical bridge
3. All anomalies (NDEs, terminal lucidity) explained as brain artifacts

**Current Status:**
No progress toward null hypothesis after 50+ years of research.

---

## 4.4 Falsifiability

### What Would Disprove Our Hypothesis:

| Prediction | Falsification Condition |
|------------|------------------------|
| H1 | A materialist theory explains Anubhava (direct-experience) |
| H2 | Consciousness explained from non-consciousness |
| H3 | NDEs proven to be brain artifacts with mechanism |
| H4 | Backend model contradicts observations |
| H₀ | Any of the above |

### Specific Falsifiable Claims:

1. **If** a mechanism is found that logically derives "feeling red" from "photon wavelength" → **H1 falsified**
2. **If** consciousness is explained without presupposing consciousness → **H2 falsified**
3. **If** all NDEs are shown to occur during brain activity (not flat EEG) → **H3 weakened**
4. **If** Backend model makes incorrect predictions → **H4 falsified**
