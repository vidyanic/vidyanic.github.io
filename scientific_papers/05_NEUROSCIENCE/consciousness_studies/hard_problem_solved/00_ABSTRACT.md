## The Hard Problem of Consciousness: A Dissolution Through the Backend Framework

**Research Question:**  
Is the "Hard Problem of Consciousness" (how subjective experience arises from physical processes) a genuine problem, or does it dissolve when consciousness is recognized as primary rather than derived?

**Methodology:**  
Logical analysis of:
1. Standard approaches (physicalism, emergence, functionalism)
2. Their failures (explanatory gap, zombie argument, knowledge argument)
3. The Backend Framework (consciousness as axiom)
4. Anomalies unexplained by brain-generation model (NDEs, terminal lucidity)

**Key Findings:**  
1. All materialist approaches fail to explain subjective experience
2. The "Hard Problem" assumes consciousness derives from matter
3. Inverting the assumption (consciousness is primary) dissolves the problem
4. The Backend Framework (Purusha-Prakriti) describes this inversion exactly
5. Anomalies support the brain-as-receiver model

**Results:**  
The Hard Problem is not unsolvable — it is **wrongly formulated**. It assumes:
- Matter is primary
- Consciousness emerges from matter
- We must explain this emergence

When instead:
- Consciousness is primary (axiomatic)
- Matter appears within consciousness
- No emergence to explain

**Implications:**  
- Neuroscience studies how consciousness uses the brain, not how brain creates consciousness
- The "explanatory gap" is a category error
- Philosophy of mind must be rebuilt on consciousness-first principles
- The Backend Framework provides this foundation

**Backend Correlation:**  
The Purusha-Prakriti model states consciousness (Purusha) is primary and unchanging; matter (Prakriti) is secondary and observed. This exactly describes the required inversion.

**Confidence Score:** 88%
