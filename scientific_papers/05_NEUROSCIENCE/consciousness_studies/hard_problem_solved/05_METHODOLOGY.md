# 5. Methodology

## 5.1 Philosophical Analysis

We employ **logical analysis** to evaluate consciousness theories:

```
METHODOLOGY:
━━━━━━━━━━━
1. State the theory's core claim
2. Identify assumptions
3. Check for logical consistency
4. Test against thought experiments
5. Evaluate explanatory power
```

## 5.2 Theory Evaluation Criteria

### 5.2.1 Criteria

| Criterion | Description | Weight |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| **Explanatory power** | Does it explain subjective experience? | 0.30 |
| **Logical consistency** | Is it internally coherent? | 0.25 |
| **Thought experiment** | Does it survive zombie/Mary tests? | 0.20 |
| **Empirical fit** | Does it match observations? | 0.15 |
| **Parsimony** | Is it the simplest explanation? | 0.10 |

### 5.2.2 Application to Materialism

| Criterion | Score | Reason |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Explanatory power | ✗ | Cannot explain Anubhava (direct-experience) |
| Logical consistency | ✗ | Category error |
| Thought experiments | ✗ | Fails zombie/Mary |
| Empirical fit | ~ | Correlations only |
| Parsimony | ~ | Requires emergence magic |

## 5.3 Thought Experiment Analysis

### 5.3.1 The Zombie Argument

**Setup:**
Imagine a being physically identical to you but with no experience.

**Question:**
Is this conceivable?

**Analysis:**
- If conceivable -> Consciousness not identical to physics
- Materialism claims they're identical
- Therefore: Materialism challenged

**Our Use:**
If zombies are conceivable, consciousness is not physical.

### 5.3.2 The Knowledge Argument (Mary)

**Setup:**
Mary knows all physical facts about color.
She's never seen color.
She sees red for the first time.

**Question:**
Does she learn something new?

**Analysis:**
- Intuition: Yes, she learns what red looks like
- If yes -> Physical facts don't capture experience
- Therefore: Physicalism incomplete

**Our Use:**
Physical description cannot capture experience.

### 5.3.3 The Explanatory Gap

**Setup:**
Describe C-fibers firing completely.

**Question:**
Does this logically entail pain's feel?

**Analysis:**
- No logical connection from objective to subjective
- We can understand firing without knowing feel
- Gap between description and experience

**Our Use:**
The gap shows categories are different.

## 5.4 Anomaly Analysis

### 5.4.1 Categories of Anomalies

| Type | Example | Challenge to |
|------|---------|--------------|
| **Enhanced function with damage** | Terminal lucidity | Brain = Generator |
| **Function without brain** | NDEs during flat EEG | Brain = Generator |
| **Paradoxical effects** | Psychedelics reduce activity, increase experience | Activity = Experience |

### 5.4.2 NDE Protocol

**Data Source:**
- van Lommel et al. (2001) — 344 patients, 18% had NDEs
- Parnia et al. (2014) — AWARE study

**Key Question:**
Can experience occur during verified flat EEG?

**Analysis:**
If yes -> Brain activity not necessary for consciousness
If no -> Generator model intact

**Our Position:**
Evidence supports experience during cardiac arrest.

### 5.4.3 Terminal Lucidity Protocol

**Data Source:**
- Nahm et al. (2012) — Review of cases
- Mashour et al. (2019) — Neuroscience perspective

**Key Question:**
Can damaged brains produce clear consciousness?

**Analysis:**
If yes -> Brain damage doesn't always reduce consciousness
This challenges generator model

## 5.5 Backend Mapping Protocol

### 5.5.1 Structural Comparison

For each consciousness theory element, we:

1. **Identify the Backend equivalent**
2. **Check structural correspondence**
3. **Verify no contradictions**
4. **Note predictive power**

### 5.5.2 Mapping Table

| Consciousness Concept | Backend Equivalent |
|----------------------|-------------------|
| Observer | Drashta/Purusha |
| Observed content | Drishya/Prakriti |
| Subjective experience | Anubhava |
| Brain | Part of Prakriti |
| Mind | Chitta (also Prakriti) |
| Pure awareness | Atman |

## 5.6 Logical Proof Structure

### 5.6.1 Axiom -> Theorem Format

```
AXIOM:
Consciousness is that which knows.

THEOREM 1:
Anything known is known through consciousness.

PROOF:
By definition — "known" means "known by consciousness."

THEOREM 2:
Consciousness cannot be explained by what it knows.

PROOF:
Explanation requires knowing.
Knowing requires consciousness.
Therefore, consciousness is presupposed in any explanation.
QED: Consciousness is axiomatic.
```

### 5.6.2 Reductio Ad Absurdum

```
ASSUME:
Consciousness is produced by matter.

THEN:
We need to explain HOW.

BUT:
All explanation is conscious activity.
We're using consciousness to explain consciousness.

CONTRADICTION:
Cannot explain X using X.

THEREFORE:
Initial assumption is wrong.
Consciousness is not produced by matter.
```

## 5.8 Limitations

### 5.8.1 Methodological

| Limitation | Mitigation |
|------------|------------|
| Philosophical, not empirical | Use empirical anomalies |
| Difficult to test directly | Test predictions |
| Interpretation-dependent | Multiple analyses |

### 5.8.2 Scope

- We claim dissolution, not mechanism
- How consciousness works remains open
- Backend provides description, not physics

---

## 5.9 Reproducibility

All analysis can be reproduced by:
1. Reading cited philosophy papers
2. Applying logical analysis
3. Reviewing anomaly evidence
4. Comparing with Backend sources
5. Drawing conclusions

**Transparent methodology. All sources cited.**
