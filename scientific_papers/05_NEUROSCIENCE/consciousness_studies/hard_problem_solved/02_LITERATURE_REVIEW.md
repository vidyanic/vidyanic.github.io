# 2. Literature Review

## 2.1 History of the Mind-Body Problem

### 2.1.1 Classical Philosophy

| Philosopher | Position | Core Claim |
|-------------|----------|------------|
| Plato | Dualism | Soul separate from body |
| Aristotle | Hylomorphism | Soul is form of body |
| Descartes | Substance Dualism | Mind and body are different substances |
| Spinoza | Neutral Monism | One substance, two aspects |
| Leibniz | Parallelism | Mind and body parallel, don't interact |

### 2.1.2 Modern Philosophy

| Philosopher | Position | Core Claim |
|-------------|----------|------------|
| Ryle | Behaviorism | Mind IS behavior |
| Place/Smart | Identity Theory | Mental = Brain states |
| Putnam | Functionalism | Mind = Function |
| Nagel | Anti-Reductionism | Consciousness irreducible |
| Chalmers | Property Dualism | Consciousness is fundamental |

## 2.2 Key Papers

### 2.2.1 The Hard Problem

**Chalmers, D. (1995).** "Facing Up to the Problem of Consciousness." *Journal of Consciousness Studies*, 2(3), 200-219.
- Introduced "Hard Problem" terminology
- Distinguished easy from hard problems
- Argued against reductive approaches

### 2.2.2 The Explanatory Gap

**Levine, J. (1983).** "Materialism and Qualia: The Explanatory Gap." *Pacific Philosophical Quarterly*, 64(4), 354-361.
- Identified gap between physical and experiential
- Showed no logical derivation from brain to feeling

### 2.2.3 What It's Like

**Nagel, T. (1974).** "What Is It Like to Be a Bat?" *Philosophical Review*, 83(4), 435-450.
- Defined subjective character of experience
- Showed it can't be captured objectively
- Influential anti-reductionist argument

### 2.2.4 The Knowledge Argument

**Jackson, F. (1982).** "Epiphenomenal Qualia." *Philosophical Quarterly*, 32(127), 127-136.
- Mary the colorblind scientist
- Knows all physical facts about color
- Still learns something new when she sees red
- Therefore: physical facts don't capture experience

### 2.2.5 Zombies

**Kirk, R. (1974).** "Zombies versus Materialists." *Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society*, 48, 135-152.
**Chalmers, D. (1996).** *The Conscious Mind*. Oxford University Press.
- Zombie = physically identical, no experience
- If conceivable → consciousness not physical
- Major argument against physicalism

## 2.3 Responses to the Hard Problem

### 2.3.1 Illusionism

**Dennett, D. (1991).** *Consciousness Explained*. Little, Brown.
**Frankish, K. (2016).** "Illusionism as a Theory of Consciousness." *JCS*, 23(11-12), 11-39.

Claim: Consciousness as "something extra" is an illusion.
Problem: Illusion for whom? Requires experiencer.

### 2.3.2 Higher-Order Theories

**Rosenthal, D. (1986).** "Two Concepts of Consciousness." *Philosophical Studies*, 49(3), 329-359.

Claim: Consciousness = Higher-order representations.
Problem: Representations of WHAT? Still need original experience.

### 2.3.3 Integrated Information Theory (IIT)

**Tononi, G. (2008).** "Consciousness as Integrated Information." *Biological Bulletin*, 215(3), 216-242.

Claim: Consciousness = Integrated information (Φ).
Problem: Why does integrated information FEEL like anything?

### 2.3.4 Global Workspace Theory

**Baars, B. (1988).** *A Cognitive Theory of Consciousness*. Cambridge University Press.

Claim: Consciousness = Global broadcast.
Problem: Explains access, not experience.

## 2.4 Alternative Paradigms

### 2.4.1 Panpsychism

**Chalmers, D. (2015).** "Panpsychism and Panprotopsychism." In *Consciousness in the Physical World*.
**Goff, P. (2017).** *Consciousness and Fundamental Reality*. Oxford University Press.

Claim: Consciousness is fundamental, everywhere.
Strength: Takes experience seriously.
Problem: Combination problem (how do micro-experiences combine?).

### 2.4.2 Idealism

**Kastrup, B. (2019).** *The Idea of the World*. iff Books.

Claim: Consciousness is primary; matter is appearance.
Strength: Dissolves Hard Problem.
Problem: Counterintuitive to scientific culture.

## 2.5 Backend Sources

### 2.5.1 Samkhya Philosophy

The oldest systematic consciousness philosophy.

**Samkhya Karika (Ishvarakrishna, c. 350 CE):**
> "पुरुषोऽस्ति भोक्तृभावात्"
> "Purusha exists because there is an experiencer"

Core claims:
- Purusha (consciousness) is primary, unchanging
- Prakriti (matter) is secondary, changing
- Purusha observes, Prakriti is observed
- They are ontologically distinct

### 2.5.2 Yoga Philosophy

**Yoga Sutras (Patanjali, c. 200 BCE):**
> "द्रष्टा दृशिमात्रः"
> "The Seer is pure seeing only"

Core claims:
- Consciousness (Drashta) is irreducible
- Mind (Chitta) is part of observed world
- Experience is not produced by mind
- Mind is instrument, not source

### 2.5.3 Advaita Vedanta

**Mandukya Upanishad (c. 800 BCE):**
> "अयमात्मा ब्रह्म"
> "This Self is Brahman"

Core claims:
- Individual consciousness = Universal consciousness
- All experience is within consciousness
- Matter is appearance, consciousness is reality

## 2.6 Neuroscience and Consciousness

### 2.6.1 Neural Correlates

**Koch, C., & Crick, F. (1990s-2000s).** Neural Correlates of Consciousness (NCC).

Finding: Specific brain patterns correlate with specific experiences.
Limitation: Correlation ≠ Causation. Correlation ≠ Identity.

### 2.6.2 Anomalies

**van Lommel, P. et al. (2001).** "Near-death experience in survivors of cardiac arrest." *Lancet*, 358, 2039-2045.

Finding: Rich experiences during clinical death (flat EEG).
Implication: Consciousness may not depend on brain activity.

**Nahm, M. et al. (2012).** "Terminal lucidity: A review." *Archives of Gerontology and Geriatrics*, 55(1), 138-142.

Finding: Clarity returns in dying patients with damaged brains.
Implication: Brain damage doesn't always reduce consciousness.

## 2.7 Gap in Literature

Despite extensive work:
- No mechanism for consciousness generation
- Explanatory gap remains
- Hard Problem unsolved

What's needed:
- Inversion of assumptions
- Consciousness-first framework
- Integration of Backend insights

**This paper addresses these gaps.**
