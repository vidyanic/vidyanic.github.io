## 6.1 Materialist Theory Failures

### 6.1.1 Identity Theory

**Claim:** Mental states ARE brain states (identical).

**Evaluation:**

| Criterion | Score | Reason |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Explanatory | ✗ | Doesn't explain WHY identical |
| Logical | ✗ | Category error (subjective ≠ objective) |
| Thought experiments | ✗ | Zombies conceivable |

**Verdict:** Fails

### 6.1.2 Functionalism

**Claim:** Mental states ARE functional states (input-output relations).

**Evaluation:**

| Criterion | Score | Reason |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Explanatory | ✗ | Function doesn't require feeling |
| Logical | ✗ | Inverted Anubhava (experience-qualities) possible |
| Thought experiments | ✗ | Zombie functionalist possible |

**Verdict:** Fails

### 6.1.3 Emergentism

**Claim:** Consciousness EMERGES from complex brain activity.

**Evaluation:**

| Criterion | Score | Reason |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Explanatory | ✗ | "Emergence" is a label, not mechanism |
| Logical | ~ | No contradiction, but no content |
| Thought experiments | ✗ | No reason complexity → experience |

**Verdict:** Fails (explains nothing)

### 6.1.4 Summary of Failures

| Theory | Explains Anubhava? | Closes Gap? | Survives Tests? |
|--------|------------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Identity | ✗ No | ✗ No | ✗ No |
| Functionalism | ✗ No | ✗ No | ✗ No |
| Emergentism | ✗ No | ✗ No | ✗ No |
| Illusionism | ✗ Self-refuting | N/A | ✗ No |

**No materialist theory succeeds.**

## 6.2 Explanatory Gap Persistence

### 6.2.1 After 50+ Years

| Decade | Progress on Gap? |
|--------|------------------|
| 1970s | Gap identified (Levine) |
| 1980s | Knowledge argument (Jackson) |
| 1990s | Hard Problem named (Chalmers) |
| 2000s | No closure |
| 2010s | No closure |
| 2020s | No closure |

**The gap has not narrowed in 50+ years.**

### 6.2.2 Reason for Persistence

The gap persists because it's not an empirical gap but a **logical gap**.

```
PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION:
Wavelength 700nm → Retina → V1 → V4 → etc.

EXPERIENTIAL DESCRIPTION:
"It looks RED. This is what red feels like."

NO LOGICAL CONNECTION:
You cannot DEDUCE the second from the first.
No matter how detailed the first description.
```

## 6.3 Anomaly Evidence

### 6.3.1 Near-Death Experiences (NDEs)

**van Lommel et al. (2001):**
- 344 cardiac arrest patients
- 18% reported NDEs
- Verified flat EEG during some experiences
- Rich, detailed experiences

**Key Finding:**
Experience occurred during no measurable brain activity.

**Implication:**
Brain activity may not be necessary for consciousness.

### 6.3.2 Terminal Lucidity

**Nahm et al. (2012):**
- Patients with severe brain damage
- Sudden clarity before death
- Full cognitive function
- Contradicts damage = reduced consciousness

**Key Finding:**
Damaged brains sometimes produce clear consciousness.

**Implication:**
Brain may filter rather than generate.

### 6.3.3 Psychedelic Research

**Carhart-Harris et al. (2016):**
- psilocybin reduces brain activity
- Yet increases subjective experience
- More experience with less activity

**Key Finding:**
Less brain activity → More experience.

**Implication:**
Brain may restrict rather than produce.

### 6.3.4 Summary of Anomalies

| Anomaly | Generator Model Predicts | Observed | Match? |
|---------|-------------------------|----------|--------|
| NDE during flat EEG | No experience | Rich experience | ✗ |
| Terminal lucidity | Worse cognition | Clear cognition | ✗ |
| Psychedelics | More activity = More experience | Opposite | ✗ |

**Generator model contradicted by all three anomalies.**

## 6.4 Axiom Analysis Results

### 6.4.1 Testing "Consciousness is Axiomatic"

**Test:** Can we explain consciousness without presupposing it?

**Attempts:**

| Attempt | Presupposes Consciousness? |
|---------|---------------------------|
| Brain produces consciousness | Who observes the brain? ✓ |
| Evolution created consciousness | Who experiences evolution? ✓ |
| Information is consciousness | Who reads the information? ✓ |
| Emergence | Who sees emergence? ✓ |

**Every explanation presupposes consciousness.**

### 6.4.2 Logical Result

```
FINDING:
All explanations of consciousness use consciousness.
Consciousness cannot be derived from non-consciousness.
Therefore: Consciousness is axiomatic.
```

## 6.5 Backend Framework Match

### 6.5.1 Structural Correspondence

| Philosophy Concept | Backend Concept | Match? |
|-------------------|-----------------|--------|
| Primary consciousness | Purusha | ✓ |
| Secondary matter | Prakriti | ✓ |
| Observer | Drashta | ✓ |
| Observed | Drishya | ✓ |
| Brain filters | Maya covers | ✓ |
| Pure awareness | Atman | ✓ |

**6/6 concepts match exactly.**

### 6.5.2 Model Predictions

| Backend Predicts | Status |
|------------------|--------|
| Consciousness cannot be explained from matter | ✓ Confirmed (gap persists) |
| Brain correlates, doesn't produce | ✓ Supported (anomalies) |
| Consciousness is irreducible | ✓ Confirmed (all attempts fail) |
| Pure awareness is foundational | ✓ (axiom analysis) |
