## 💡 The Key Insight

**Neuroscience asks:** "How does the brain create consciousness?"
**Wrong question.**

**Vedas show:** Brain RECEIVES consciousness, like a radio receives signal.

```
MATERIALIST VIEW           VEDIC VIEW
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━            ━━━━━━━━━━━
Brain → generates mind     Atman → uses brain
Damage → less function     Damage → less filter
Death → consciousness ends Death → consciousness exits
```

---

**The Test:**
- If brain GENERATES mind: Damage should ONLY reduce function
- If brain RECEIVES mind: Damage could INCREASE function (by reducing filter)

**Evidence:** Terminal lucidity, acquired savants, NDEs during flatline
**Conclusion:** Brain is receiver, not generator
