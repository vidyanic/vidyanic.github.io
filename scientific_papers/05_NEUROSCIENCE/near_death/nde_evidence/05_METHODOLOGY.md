# 5. Methodology

## 5.1 Research Approach

This paper synthesizes 50+ years of NDE research, focusing on:
- Prospective studies (strongest evidence)
- Veridical perception cases
- Special populations (blind, children)
- Failed alternative explanations

## 5.2 Study Types Analyzed

| Study Type | Strengths | Weaknesses | Examples |
|------------|-----------|------------|----------|
| **Prospective** | Pre-registered, controlled | Expensive, rare | Van Lommel, AWARE |
| **Retrospective** | Large samples | Memory concerns | Moody, Ring |
| **Case studies** | Detailed verification | Selection bias | Sabom cases |
| **Cross-cultural** | Tests cultural influence | Variable methodology | Pasricha, Fenwick |

## 5.3 Inclusion Criteria

### 5.3.1 For Core Analysis

Studies must have:
- Peer-reviewed publication
- Clear NDE definition (Greyson Scale or equivalent)
- Documented medical status
- Sample size ≥20

### 5.3.2 For Veridical Cases

Cases must have:

## 5.4 Evaluation Framework

### 5.4.1 For Each Study

```
EVALUATION CRITERIA:
═════════════════════

1. DESIGN QUALITY
   - Prospective vs retrospective
   - Sample size
   - Control conditions

2. DOCUMENTATION
   - Medical status verified
   - EEG/cardiac monitoring
   - Timing established

3. VERIFICATION
   - Veridical claims checked
   - Independent verification
   - Multiple witnesses

4. ALTERNATIVE EXPLANATIONS
   - Hypoxia ruled out
   - Drugs ruled out
   - False memory addressed
```

### 5.4.2 For Alternative Explanations

Each explanation must account for:
- Experience during documented brain shutdown
- Veridical accurate perceptions
- Blind visual experiences
- Cross-cultural consistency

## 5.5 Confidence Scoring

| Score | Meaning | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|
| 90-100% | Multiple replications, verified | Core NDE features |
| 80-89% | Strong evidence, some questions | Veridical perceptions |
| 70-79% | Good evidence, needs replication | Blind sight |
| 60-69% | Suggestive, insufficient data | Shared death |
| <60% | Preliminary | New phenomena |
