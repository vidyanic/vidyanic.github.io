# 7. Anomalies & Special Cases

## 7.1 Shared Death Experiences

### 7.1.1 Definition

A Shared Death Experience (SDE) occurs when someone at the bedside of a dying person shares elements of the dying person's NDE:
- Sees the same light
- Experiences life review with them
- Meets deceased relatives (sometimes unknown to the experiencer)

### 7.1.2 Cases

**Raymond Moody's Mother-in-Law Case:**
- Mother-in-law dying
- Family member present
- Both saw "light beings" approach
- Family member saw mother-in-law's life review
- Family member not dying

**Significance:** If NDEs were brain artifacts, they couldn't be shared.

## 7.2 Deathbed Visions

### 7.2.1 Definition

Dying patients report seeing deceased relatives, unknown to be dead:

| Case Type | Significance |
|-----------|--------------|
| See relative just died | No normal information source |
| See deceased unknown to patient | Cannot be expectation |
| Cross-cultural | Universal phenomenon |

### 7.2.2 Key Studies

**Osis & Haraldsson (1977):** Cross-cultural study (US and India)
- Dying patients see deceased relatives
- Sometimes relatives whose death was unknown
- Not explained by expectation or wish-fulfillment

## 7.3 Peak in Darien Cases

### 7.3.1 Definition

NDE experiencer meets deceased person whose death was unknown to them:

**Classic Case:**
- Child has NDE during surgery
- Meets "lady in tunnel"
- Describes her accurately
- Later identified as grandmother
- **Grandmother died during patient's surgery**
- No way patient could know

### 7.3.2 Significance

```
THE LOGIC:
═══════════

1. Patient is unconscious
2. Meets person in NDE
3. Person has just died
4. Patient doesn't know about death
5. Later describes person accurately
6. Identified as the deceased

CONCLUSION: Information from non-physical source
```

## 7.4 Children's NDEs

### 7.4.1 Why Children Matter

- Less cultural contamination
- No expectation of NDE features
- Often occur before media exposure
- Difficult to fabricate complex narrative

### 7.4.2 Findings

**Morse (1990):** *Closer to the Light*

| Finding | Significance |
|---------|--------------|
| Core features match adults | Not learned from media |
| Features appear before education | Not expectation |
| Some veridical perceptions | Not imagination |
| Long-term positive effects | Real transformation |

## 7.5 Distressing NDEs

### 7.5.1 Not All NDEs Are Pleasant

~10-15% of NDEs are frightening:
- Void/nothingness
- Demonic entities
- Hellish imagery
- Terror

### 7.5.2 Backend Interpretation

```
BACKEND EXPLANATION:
════════════════════

• Lower Lokas (frequency bands) exist
• Atala, Vitala, etc. — "hellish" realms
• Individual may briefly contact these
• Karma/Guna composition determines experience
• Not punishment — just frequency match

See: 14 Lokas in Backend Architecture

## 7.6 Anomalies Summary

| Anomaly | Materialist Problem | Non-Local Explanation |
|---------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| Shared death | How share brain artifact? | Consciousness is shared field |
| Peak in Darien | Unknown death information | Non-local knowing |
| Children | Not culturally learned | Genuine experience |
| Blind sight | No visual cortex input | Perception not retinal |
| Distressing | Contradicts wish-fulfillment | Multiple Lokas/frequencies |
