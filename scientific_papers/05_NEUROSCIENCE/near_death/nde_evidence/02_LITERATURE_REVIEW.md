# 2. Literature Review

> **📖 Key Terms:** See [Dictionary](./01_FOUNDATION/DICTIONARY.md)

## 2.1 Foundational Works

### 2.1.1 Raymond Moody (1975)

**Life After Life** — First systematic collection of NDE accounts

Key contributions:
- Coined the term "Near-Death Experience"
- Identified common elements
- Brought NDEs into mainstream discussion

### 2.1.2 Kenneth Ring (1980)

**Life at Death** — First scientific study

- Interviewed 102 near-death survivors
- Found consistent core experience across cases
- Developed weighted core experience index

## 2.2 Major Prospective Studies

### 2.2.1 Van Lommel Study (Lancet, 2001)

**The most rigorous prospective study to date**

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Location** | 10 Dutch hospitals |
| **Sample** | 344 cardiac arrest survivors |
| **Design** | Prospective |
| **Duration** | 1988-1992 |
| **Follow-up** | 2 and 8 years |

**Findings:**

| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| NDE incidence | 18% (62 patients) |
| Deep NDE (score ≥10) | 12% |
| OBE | 24% of NDEs |
| Life review | 13% of NDEs |
| Meeting deceased | 32% of NDEs |
| Light | 23% of NDEs |

**Critical Finding:**
> "Our results show that medical factors cannot account for occurrence of NDE."

**Veridical Cases:**
Multiple patients reported accurate perceptions during cardiac arrest, including:
- Nurse removing dentures during CPR
- Specific resuscitation details
- Conversations in other rooms

### 2.2.2 AWARE Study (Parnia, 2014)

**First multi-center prospective study with hidden targets**

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Location** | 15 hospitals, UK/US/Austria |
| **Sample** | 2,060 cardiac arrests |
| **Survivors** | 330 |
| **Interviewed** | 140 |
| **Design** | Prospective with hidden targets |

**Findings:**

| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Awareness during CPR | 46% of survivors |
| Visual/auditory recall | 9% |
| OBE-type awareness | 2% |
| Verified perception | 1 detailed case |

**The Verified Case (Patient 10):**
- Accurately described CPR events
- Perceived from ceiling-level vantage point
- Described automated external defibrillator sounds
- Recalled nurse pumping chest
- **All verified by hospital staff**

## 2.3 Veridical Perception Research

### 2.3.1 Michael Sabom (1982)

**Recollections of Death** — First veridical verification study

Compared:
- NDE patients' descriptions of their resuscitation
- Non-NDE patients' guesses about resuscitation

**Finding:** NDE patients significantly more accurate than guessers.

### 2.3.2 Penny Sartori (2006)

**The Near-Death Experiences of Hospitalized Intensive Care Patients**

- 39 NDEs documented
- 9 with OBE component
- Compared accuracy of OBE perceptions to controls
- OBE group: Highly accurate
- Control group (guessing): Mostly wrong

---

## 2.4 Special Populations

### 2.4.1 Blind People (Ring & Cooper, 1999)

**Mindsight** — NDEs in the blind

| Population | n | Finding |
|------------|---|---------|
| Congenitally blind | 10 | Reported visual perception |
| Adventitiously blind | 11 | Reported visual perception |
| Severely impaired | 10 | Reported visual perception |

**Key Case:** Vicki Umipeg
- Blind from birth (premature infant retinopathy)
- NDE during car accident
- Reported seeing for first time
- Accurately described wedding ring, hair color
- Said seeing was "frightening" (never experienced before)

### 2.4.2 Children (Morse, 1990)

**Closer to the Light** — NDEs in children

| Finding | Significance |
|---------|--------------|
| Children report similar NDEs to adults | Not culturally learned |
| Features match before exposure to NDE media | Not from books/movies |
| Some children report verified perceptions | Not imagination |

---

## 2.5 Cross-Cultural Studies

### 2.5.1 Consistency Across Cultures

| Culture | Core Features Present |
|---------|----------------------|
| Western | Yes |
| Indian | Yes |
| Chinese | Yes |
| African | Yes |
| Native American | Yes |

**Note:** Cultural variations exist in interpretation (religious figures vary), but core features (OBE, light, deceased) are universal.

---

## 2.6 Alternative Explanations Literature

### 2.6.1 Hypoxia Theory

**Claim:** Oxygen deprivation causes NDE-like experiences

**Studies Against:**
- Whinnery (1997): Fighter pilot blackout differs from NDEs
- Van Lommel (2001): Blood gases normal in NDE vs non-NDE

### 2.6.2 Drug Theory

**Claim:** Endogenous or exogenous drugs cause NDEs

**Studies Against:**
- Jansen (1997): Ketamine experiences differ qualitatively
- Van Lommel (2001): Medication didn't predict NDE

### 2.6.3 REM Intrusion

**Claim:** NDEs are REM sleep intruding into waking

**Studies Against:**
- Nelson (2006): Some correlation, but doesn't explain veridical
- REM requires brain activity; cardiac arrest has none

---

## 2.7 Summary

| Study Type | Key Finding | Supports |
|------------|-------------|----------|
| Prospective | 18% incidence in cardiac arrest | NDEs are real |
| Veridical | Accurate perceptions during arrest | Non-local perception |
| Blind | Visual experience without eyes | Consciousness not retinal |
| Cross-cultural | Universal core features | Not cultural artifact |
| Alternative | Explanations fail | Not simple brain dysfunction |
