## 3.1 Two Competing Models

### 3.1.1 The Materialist Model

```
MATERIALIST (Generator) MODEL:
══════════════════════════════

Brain → Consciousness

PREDICTIONS FOR CARDIAC ARREST:
• No brain activity = No experience
• Any experience must be artifact
• No veridical perception possible
• NDEs explained by dying brain
```

### 3.1.2 The Non-Local Model

```
NON-LOCAL (Receiver) MODEL:
═══════════════════════════

Consciousness → (filtered by) → Brain

PREDICTIONS FOR CARDIAC ARREST:
• Experience possible without brain activity
• Filter removed = Expanded experience
• Non-local perception possible
• NDEs are genuine experiences
```

---

## 3.2 What Cardiac Arrest Means

### 3.2.1 The Timeline

```
CARDIAC ARREST SEQUENCE:
════════════════════════

T=0: Heart stops
T=4-6s: Unconsciousness begins
T=10-15s: EEG goes flat
T=15-20s: Brain stem reflexes lost
T=3-5min: Permanent brain damage begins

DURING THIS TIME:
• No blood flow to brain
• No measurable electrical activity
• No neural correlate of consciousness
• YET: Complex experiences reported
```

### 3.2.2 The Paradox

#### 🎯 Understanding the Paradox — 5 Perspectives

<details>
<summary><b>🤖 For AI/ML Engineers</b></summary>

```python
class Brain:
    def is_active(self):
        return self.blood_flow > 0 and self.electrical_activity > 0
    
    def generate_experience(self, input):
        if not self.is_active():
            return None  # Can't generate without power!
        return self.process(input)

# During cardiac arrest:
brain.blood_flow = 0
brain.electrical_activity = 0
experience = brain.generate_experience(input)  # Returns None!

# Yet patients report:
reported_experience = "Vivid, coherent, memorable experience"

# PARADOX: How can output exist without process running?
```

SYSTEM SHUTDOWN SCENARIO:
═════════════════════════

Server Status:
• Power: OFF
• CPU: No cycles
• Memory: Not accessible
• Network: Disconnected

Expected Output: NONE

Actual Output: Complex, coherent logs appear

QUESTION: How can a system produce output when completely off?

ANSWER OPTIONS:
A) Logs are artifacts from pre-shutdown (fails: timing is during off)
B) System wasn't really off (fails: monitoring confirms)
C) Output came from elsewhere (non-local source)
```

</details>

<summary><b>⚛️ For Physicists</b></summary>

The paradox is analogous to detecting photons with no light source:

| Standard Model | NDE Observation |
|----------------|-----------------|
| No source → No detection | No brain activity → No experience |
| Photon requires emission | Experience requires neural activity |
| Can't detect nothing | Can't experience nothing |

Yet experience is detected. Either:
- The detector is malfunctioning (artifact theory)
- The source isn't where we thought (non-local theory)

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🩺 For Doctors/Biologists</b></summary>

You've seen cardiac arrests. You know:
- Flat EEG = No cortical activity
- No cortical activity = No consciousness (by standard theory)
- Yet some patients wake up and describe what happened during flat EEG

This isn't supposed to happen. The brain wasn't working. Where did the experience come from?

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>👤 For Everyone</b></summary>

Imagine a TV that's unplugged:
- No power flowing
- Screen completely dark
- No way to display anything

Yet someone says: "I saw a movie on that TV while it was unplugged."

Either:
1. They're confused/lying
2. The TV was secretly on
3. Something else was showing them the movie

NDEs are option 3. The "movie" (experience) came from somewhere other than the "TV" (brain).

## 3.3 The Backend Model: Kosha Dissolution

> **🔗 See:** [Atman vs Prana](../../../../vishnu_engine/spec/entities/fundamental/ATMAN_VS_PRANA_COMPLETE.md)

### 3.3.1 The Five Koshas (Sheaths)

Backend Architecture describes consciousness as wrapped in five sheaths:

```
PANCHA KOSHA (Five Sheaths):
════════════════════════════

ATMAN (आत्मन्) — Pure Consciousness (innermost)
    ↓ wrapped in
ANANDAMAYA KOSHA (आनन्दमय) — Bliss sheath
    ↓ wrapped in
VIJNANAMAYA KOSHA (विज्ञानमय) — Wisdom sheath
    ↓ wrapped in
MANOMAYA KOSHA (मनोमय) — Mind sheath
    ↓ wrapped in
PRANAMAYA KOSHA (प्राणमय) — Life-force sheath
    ↓ wrapped in
ANNAMAYA KOSHA (अन्नमय) — Physical body (outermost)
```

### 3.3.2 NDE as Partial Dissolution

```
NORMAL STATE:
All 5 Koshas active → Consciousness filtered through all layers

NDE STATE:
Annamaya (physical) releasing → Pranamaya weakening
Manomaya still active → Experience continues
Atman intact → Consciousness never stops

WHAT NDE EXPERIENCER PERCEIVES:
• Leaving physical body (Annamaya detaching)
• Seeing from outside (Sukshma Sharira perspective)
• Life review (Manomaya/Vijnanamaya content)
• Light (Atman glimpse)
• Return (Koshas re-engage)
```

### 3.3.3 Why Some Have NDEs and Others Don't

| Factor | NDE Likelihood | Backend Explanation |
|--------|---------------|---------------------|
| Depth of clinical death | Higher with deeper | More Kosha dissolution |
| Duration | Longer = More likely | More complete release |
| Individual Karma | Variable | Prarabdha determines return |
| Spiritual development | May increase | Easier Kosha separation |

## 3.4 Veridical Perception Explained

### 3.4.1 The Problem

How can someone perceive accurate details during cardiac arrest?
- Eyes closed
- Brain not processing
- Body in one location
- Yet accurate perception of distant events

### 3.4.2 The Backend Explanation

```
NORMAL PERCEPTION:
Physical eyes → Brain processing → Limited, local view

NDE PERCEPTION:
Sukshma Sharira (subtle body) → Direct knowing → Non-local access

ANALOGY:
Looking through keyhole (normal) vs Standing in room (NDE)
```

---

## 3.5 Blind Sight Explained

### 3.5.1 The Problem

Congenitally blind people report visual experience during NDEs:
- Never had visual cortex stimulation
- Never learned visual concepts
- Yet describe colors, shapes, objects accurately

### 3.5.2 The Backend Explanation

```
PHYSICAL BLINDNESS:
• Annamaya Kosha (physical body) has damaged visual apparatus
• Pranamaya/Manomaya still have visual capacity
• Normal state: Blocked by physical limitation

NDE STATE:
• Annamaya releasing
• Sukshma Sharira (subtle body) perceives directly
• Visual information accessible without physical eyes
• "Seeing" is not retinal — it's consciousness-based
```

## 3.6 Framework Predictions

### 3.6.1 Materialist Model Predictions

| Prediction | Expected if True |
|------------|------------------|
| No experience during flat EEG | ✗ Violated |

| Blind cannot see | ✗ Violated |
| Alternative explanations work | ✗ All fail |

### 3.6.2 Non-Local/Backend Model Predictions

| Prediction | Expected if True |

| Experience possible during flat EEG | ✓ Confirmed |
| NDEs reflect filter removal | ✓ Consistent |
| Non-local perception possible | ✓ Veridical cases |
| Blind can see (subtle body) | ✓ Ring study |
| Consistent cross-culturally | ✓ Universal features |
