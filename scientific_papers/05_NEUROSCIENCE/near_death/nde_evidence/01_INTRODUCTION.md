## 1.1 What Is a Near-Death Experience?

A Near-Death Experience (NDE) is a profound subjective experience that occurs in individuals who are:
- Clinically dead (cardiac arrest, no pulse, no respiration)
- Very close to death (serious illness, accident)
- In situations where death seemed imminent

## 1.2 Common NDE Features

### 1.2.1 The Core Experience

Based on thousands of documented cases, NDEs typically include:

| Feature | Description | Frequency |
|---------|-------------|-----------|
| **Peace/well-being** | Profound sense of calm | 60-80% |
| **Out-of-body (OBE)** | Seeing body from outside | 50-60% |
| **Tunnel** | Moving through darkness | 30-40% |
| **Light** | Brilliant, loving light | 50-60% |
| **Life review** | Panoramic memory review | 20-30% |
| **Deceased persons** | Meeting dead relatives | 30-40% |
| **Boundary/limit** | Point of no return | 20-30% |
| **Return** | Decision or forced return | 60-80% |

### 1.2.2 The Greyson Scale

Dr. Bruce Greyson developed a 16-item scale measuring:

```
GREYSON NDE SCALE (0-32 points):
================================

COGNITIVE (0-8):
• Time distortion
• Thought acceleration
• Life review
• Sudden understanding

AFFECTIVE (0-8):
• Peace/well-being
• Joy
• Cosmic unity
• Encountering light

PARANORMAL (0-8):
• Vivid senses
• Extrasensory perception
• Precognition
• Out-of-body experience

TRANSCENDENTAL (0-8):
• Unearthly realm
• Mystical being
• Deceased spirits
• Border/point of no return

THRESHOLD: ≥7 points = NDE
```

## 1.3 Why This Matters

### 1.3.1 The Scientific Problem

```
THE MATERIALIST PARADOX:
========================

PREMISE: Brain generates consciousness

OBSERVATION: NDEs occur during cardiac arrest

CARDIAC ARREST MEANS:
• No pulse (heart stopped)
• No respiration
• Blood flow to brain: ZERO
• EEG: FLAT (no measurable brain activity)
• Duration: 10-20 seconds to unconsciousness

YET: Rich, coherent, memorable experiences occur

QUESTION: How can a non-functioning brain generate experience?
```

### 1.3.2 The Stakes

If NDEs are genuine experiences during brain shutdown:
- Consciousness is not brain-dependent
- Death may not end consciousness
- The materialist paradigm is incomplete
- The receiver model (see [Brain as Receiver](../../brain_mind/brain_as_receiver)) is supported

## 1.4 Materialist Explanations

Materialists have proposed several explanations:

| Explanation | Claim | Problem |
|-------------|-------|---------|
| **Hypoxia** | Oxygen deprivation causes hallucinations | NDEs occur without hypoxia; hypoxia causes confusion, not clarity |
| **Drugs** | Ketamine, endorphins | Drug experiences qualitatively different; NDEs occur without drugs |
| **REM intrusion** | Dream-like state | REM requires brain activity; doesn't explain veridical perceptions |
| **Temporal lobe** | Seizure-like activity | TL experiences differ; doesn't explain cardiac arrest NDEs |
| **False memories** | Constructed after revival | Doesn't explain veridical perceptions during arrest |

Each explanation will be examined in [§6 Results](./06_RESULTS.md).

## 1.5 The Research History

### 1.5.1 Timeline

| Year | Researcher | Contribution |
|------|------------|--------------|
| 1975 | Raymond Moody | Coined "NDE," published *Life After Life* |
| 1980 | Kenneth Ring | First systematic study |
| 1983 | Bruce Greyson | Developed NDE Scale |
| 1988 | Michael Sabom | First veridical verification study |
| 2001 | Pim van Lommel | First prospective study (Lancet) |

### 1.5.2 Current State

NDE research has moved from:
- Anecdotal -> Systematic
- Retrospective -> Prospective
- Descriptive -> Quantitative
- Marginalized -> Peer-reviewed
