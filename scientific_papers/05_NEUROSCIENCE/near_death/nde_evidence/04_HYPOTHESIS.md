# 4. Hypothesis

> **📖 Key Terms:** See [Dictionary](../../../00_META/DICTIONARY.md)

## 4.1 Null Hypothesis (H₀)

**The Materialist Position:**

> NDEs are entirely brain-generated phenomena — products of a dying brain, hypoxia, drugs, or false memories constructed after revival.

### Formal Statement

```
H₀: NDE = f(Brain_dying_process)

IMPLIES:
• No experience during true brain shutdown
• Veridical perceptions are false memories
• NDEs correlate with measurable brain states
• Blind cannot have visual NDEs
• Alternative explanations sufficient
```

---

## 4.2 Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)

**The Non-Local Position:**

> NDEs provide evidence that consciousness can exist and perceive independently of brain function.

### Formal Statement

```
H₁: NDE = Consciousness_experience during Brain_shutdown

IMPLIES:
• Experience possible without brain activity
• Veridical perceptions are genuine
• NDEs may occur independently of brain state
• Perception not dependent on sensory organs
• Materialist explanations insufficient
```

## 4.3 Testable Predictions

### 4.3.1 Key Distinguishing Tests

| Test | H₀ Predicts | H₁ Predicts |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **Experience during flat EEG** | None | Possible |
| **Veridical perception** | All wrong/guesses | Some accurate |
| **Correlation with brain state** | Strong | Weak or none |
| **Blind visual experience** | Impossible | Possible |
| **Hypoxia explanation** | NDEs = Hypoxia effects | NDEs ≠ Hypoxia |
| **Drug explanation** | NDEs = Drug effects | NDEs ≠ Drug effects |

### 4.3.2 Critical Tests

**Test 1: Experience Timing**

```
If H₀: Experiences must occur when brain is active
If H₁: Experiences can occur when brain is inactive

METHOD: Prospective documentation of NDE timing vs EEG/cardiac status
RESULT: Van Lommel, AWARE show NDEs during documented arrest
SUPPORTS: H₁
```

**Test 2: Veridical Verification**

```
If H₀: All "accurate" perceptions are lucky guesses or false memories
If H₁: Some perceptions are genuinely accurate

METHOD: Hide targets, verify perceptions against records
RESULT: AWARE Patient 10, multiple van Lommel cases
SUPPORTS: H₁
```

**Test 3: Blind Subjects**

```
If H₀: Blind people cannot have visual NDEs
If H₁: Perception isn't retinal; blind can "see"

METHOD: Study congenitally blind NDE experiencers
RESULT: Ring & Cooper found visual experience in blind
SUPPORTS: H₁
```

## 4.4 Evidence Required

### 4.4.1 To Support H₀

Would require showing:
- All veridical cases are false memories
- All NDEs occur during brain activity (not arrest)
- Blind cases are fabricated or metaphorical
- Alternative explanations work

### 4.4.2 To Support H₁

Requires demonstrating:
- At least some verified accurate perceptions during arrest
- Experiences during documented brain shutdown
- Consistent features despite brain state
- Alternative explanations fail

---

## 4.5 Current Status

| Evidence Type | Supports |
|---------------|----------|
| Prospective studies | H₁ |
| Veridical perceptions | H₁ |
| Blind sight | H₁ |
| Alternative explanations | H₁ (all fail) |
| Theoretical parsimony | Contested |

## 4.6 Backend Prediction

The Backend model (Kosha dissolution) specifically predicts:

1. **Experience continues during body shutdown** — Atman is independent
2. **Expanded perception possible** — Sukshma Sharira perceives
3. **Life review occurs** — Chitragupta record accessed
4. **Light encountered** — Atman glimpse
5. **Return possible** — If Prarabdha karma incomplete

All these are observed in NDEs.
