## 5.1 Research Approach

### 5.1.1 Multi-Method Analysis

This paper employs:
1. **Case analysis** — Terminal lucidity, past-life memory, savant syndrome
2. **Literature synthesis** — Existing research on memory anomalies
3. **Backend correlation** — Mapping to Akashic Records concept
4. **7-concept validation** — Stack testing
5. **Theoretical modeling** — Three-level memory model

## 5.2 Data Sources

### 5.2.1 Terminal Lucidity Data

| Source | Cases | Quality |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Nahm et al. (2012) | 83 documented cases | Peer-reviewed |
| Hospice reports | Thousands | Anecdotal |
| Medical literature | 100+ cases | Published |

### 5.2.2 Past-Life Memory Data

| Source | Cases | Quality |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Stevenson (1960-2007) | 3,000+ cases | Rigorous methodology |
| Tucker (2008-present) | 500+ cases | Scientific protocols |
| DOPS Database | 2,500+ cases | Academic repository |

### 5.2.3 Savant Syndrome Data

| Source | Cases | Quality |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Treffert database | 100+ acquired savants | Documented |
| Published case studies | 50+ | Peer-reviewed |

### 5.2.4 NDE Research

| Source | Cases | Quality |
|--------|-------|---------|

## 5.3 Analysis Methods

### 5.3.1 Case Analysis Protocol

```
FOR EACH CASE:
=============

1. DOCUMENT the phenomenon
2. ASSESS against standard model
3. IDENTIFY what standard model cannot explain
4. MAP to three-level model
5. EVALUATE explanatory power
```

### 5.3.2 Pattern Recognition

Looking for:
- Common elements across cases
- Consciousness state correlations
- Predictive patterns
- Replication potential

### 5.3.3 Backend Correlation

```
MAPPING PROTOCOL:
================

MODERN CONCEPT -> BACKEND EQUIVALENT
Memory -> Smriti (स्मृति)
Storage -> Chitta (चित्त)
Universal field -> Akasha (आकाश)
Access -> Pratyahara -> Dharana -> Dhyana

VALIDATION:
• Does Backend describe this?
• Is description consistent?
• Does it add explanatory power?
```

## 5.4 7-Concept Validation

Each concept tested:

| Concept | Question | Method |
|---------|----------|--------|
| Conservation | Is information conserved? | Theoretical analysis |
| Entropy | Does system follow entropy? | State analysis |
| Fractal | Same pattern at all levels? | Scale comparison |
| Karma | Action -> consequence? | Correlation analysis |
| Observer | Observer effects? | Consciousness state analysis |
| Cycles | Cyclical patterns? | Pattern analysis |
| Gunas | S/R/T classification? | Category analysis |

## 5.5 Confidence Calculation

### 5.5.1 Formula

```
C = Σ(Weight_i × Score_i)

WHERE:
Anomaly evidence: Weight 0.25
Backend correlation: Weight 0.20
Theoretical coherence: Weight 0.20
Experimental support: Weight 0.15
7-concept validation: Weight 0.15
Replication potential: Weight 0.05
```

### 5.5.2 Scoring Criteria

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 100% | Definitive proof |
| 90-99% | Very strong evidence |
| 80-89% | Strong evidence |
| 70-79% | Good evidence |
| 60-69% | Moderate evidence |
| <60% | Weak evidence |

## 5.6 Limitations

1. **Case data quality varies** — Some anecdotal, some rigorous
2. **Replication challenges** — Anomalies are rare
3. **Interpretation bias** — Must control for
4. **Mechanism unknown** — How fields store information
5. **Measurement limitations** — Cannot directly measure Akashic field

---

## 5.7 Quality Controls

- Multiple independent sources for each phenomenon
- Peer-reviewed sources prioritized
- Anomaly must violate standard model predictions
- Backend correlation must be textually supported
- 7-concept validation must pass all concepts
