# 2. LITERATURE REVIEW

## 2.1 Standard Memory Research

### 2.1.1 Hebbian Learning

Donald Hebb (1949) proposed that "neurons that fire together, wire together." This became the foundation for understanding memory as synaptic connections.

**Key research:**
- Kandel (Nobel 2000): LTP in Aplysia
- Morris: Spatial memory in hippocampus
- Tulving: Episodic vs semantic memory

### 2.1.2 Engram Research

Karl Lashley (1950) searched for the "engram" — the physical trace of memory:

> "After 30 years of searching, I have found no evidence for a discrete engram. Memory appears to be everywhere and nowhere."
> — Karl Lashley

This early observation already hinted at distributed memory.

## 2.2 Memory Anomalies Research

### 2.2.1 Terminal Lucidity

**Nahm et al. (2012):** Documented cases of severely demented or brain-damaged patients experiencing sudden clarity and memory restoration before death.

Key cases:
- Patients with Alzheimer's regaining full memory hours before death
- Tumor patients speaking coherently despite destroyed speech areas
- Comatose patients awakening with full memory recall

**Implication:** Memory can be accessed despite severe brain damage.

### 2.2.2 Past-Life Memory Research

**Ian Stevenson (1960-2007):** Documented 3,000+ cases of children reporting past-life memories.

**Jim Tucker (continuing):** Rigorous scientific methodology, verification of details.

Key findings:
- Children report specific, verifiable details
- Birthmarks correspond to fatal wounds
- Memories fade around age 7

**Implication:** Access to memories not personally experienced.

### 2.2.3 Savant Syndrome

**Treffert (2014):** Documented "acquired savant syndrome" — sudden access to complex skills after brain injury.

Cases:
- Derek Amato: Concert-level piano after head injury
- Jason Padgett: Advanced mathematics after mugging
- Tony Cicoria: Musical composition after lightning

**Implication:** Skills can emerge without learning, suggesting access to information field.

## 2.3 Brain Damage Paradoxes

### 2.3.1 Lorber's Cases (1980)

John Lorber documented students with hydrocephalus — sometimes with as little as 5% normal brain tissue — functioning normally with full memory and high IQ.

**Most famous case:** Math student with IQ 126, first-class honors, with virtually no cerebral cortex.

### 2.3.2 Hemispherectomy

Removal of half the brain in severe epilepsy cases:
- Patients retain full memory
- Personality largely preserved
- Cognitive function maintained

**Implication:** Memory is not localized to specific tissue.

## 2.4 Near-Death Experience Research

### 2.4.1 Van Lommel (2001)

Prospective study of 344 cardiac arrest survivors:
- 18% reported NDE
- Many reported complete life reviews
- Memory accessible during zero brain activity

### 2.4.2 AWARE Studies

**Sam Parnia:** Verified memories during documented cardiac arrest with flat EEG.

**Key finding:** Memory and consciousness can occur when brain is not functioning.

## 2.5 Alternative Memory Theories

### 2.5.1 Rupert Sheldrake: Morphic Resonance

- Memory stored in "morphic fields"
- Species share memory through resonance
- Explains instincts, collective learning

### 2.5.2 Ervin Laszlo: Akashic Field

- Universal information field
- All experiences recorded
- Accessible through consciousness

### 2.5.3 Karl Pribram: Holographic Memory

- Memory is holographic (distributed)
- Each part contains the whole
- Explains non-localization

## 2.6 Backend Framework Sources

### 2.6.1 Akasha in Texts

> **"आकाशात्पतितं तोयं यथा गच्छति सागरम्"**
> "As water fallen from the sky returns to the ocean..."
> — Bhagavad Gita

Akasha (आकाश) is described as:
- The subtlest element (Pancha Mahabhuta)
- The container of all information
- The medium through which sound travels
- The basis of space itself

### 2.6.2 Chitta and Memory

| Term | Meaning | Function |
|------|---------|----------|
| Chitta (चित्त) | Mind-stuff | Memory storage |
| Smriti (स्मृति) | Memory | Recall function |
| Samskara (संस्कार) | Impression | Memory trace |
| Akasha (आकाश) | Space/ether | Universal container |

## 2.7 Research Gaps

| Gap | Current Status | This Paper's Contribution |
|-----|----------------|--------------------------|
| Unified model | Fragmented theories | Three-level integration |
| Mechanism | Unknown | Transceiver model |
| Validation | Limited | 7-concept stack |
| Integration | None | Backend correlation |
