# 7. ANOMALIES & EDGE CASES

## 7.1 Memory Distortion

### 7.1.1 The Question

If memory is in Akashic field, why do we have false memories?

### 7.1.2 Resolution

```
FALSE MEMORY EXPLAINED:
======================

The Akashic record is ACCURATE.
The RETRIEVAL process can introduce errors.

Sources of error:
1. LOCAL CACHE corruption (brain)
2. INTERFERENCE from other memories
3. RECONSTRUCTION errors during access
4. EMOTIONAL filtering
5. EGO-BASED distortion (Ahamkara)

The ORIGINAL is correct.
The COPY (retrieved to brain) can be corrupted.
```

## 7.2 Forgetting

### 7.2.1 The Question

If everything is in Akashic, why do we forget?

### 7.2.2 Resolution

```
FORGETTING MECHANISM:
====================

FORGETTING = Access limitation, not deletion

At LOCAL level: Cache is cleared (normal forgetting)
At EXTENDED level: Access requires intention
At AKASHIC level: Nothing is ever deleted

Why we forget:
• Attention is limited (can't access everything)
• Prioritization (what's useful now)
• Protection (trauma blocking)
• Maya (illusion of separation)

The memory EXISTS. We just can't access it normally.
Terminal lucidity proves the memory was always there.
```

## 7.3 Amnesia

### 7.3.1 The Question

How does amnesia fit the model?

### 7.3.2 Resolution

```
AMNESIA TYPES:
==============

RETROGRADE (past memory loss):
• Local cache damaged
• Access pathway disrupted
• Akashic still intact (may recover)

ANTEROGRADE (can't form new):
• Encoding pathway damaged
• Can't write to local cache
• Experience still writes to Akashic

DISSOCIATIVE (psychological):
• Access blocked by trauma
• Local copies hidden
• Can be recovered with therapy

All fit the transceiver model:
Damage affects access, not ultimate storage.
```

## 7.4 Why Can't Everyone Access Akashic?

### 7.4.1 The Question

If Akashic exists, why can't everyone access it consciously?

### 7.4.2 Resolution

```
ACCESS LIMITATIONS:
==================

1. MAYA (Illusion of separation)
   • The simulation restricts access
   • Prevents "cheating" in the game

2. KARMA (Consequences)
   • Too much access would bypass learning
   • Must earn through development

3. GUNA STATE (Receiver tuning)
   • Tamas = static noise
   • Rajas = interference
   • Sattva = clear reception

4. EVOLUTION (Progressive access)
   • Access increases with consciousness development
   • Siddhi can be developed

Full access exists in Samadhi, NDE, some dreams.
Normal restriction is BY DESIGN.

## 7.5 Memory Variations Between People

### 7.5.1 The Question

Why do people remember the same event differently?

### 7.5.2 Resolution

```
PERSPECTIVE-DEPENDENT RECORDING:
===============================

The Akashic stores EVERY perspective.
Each observer has their own record.

Same event -> Multiple records (one per observer)

When retrieving:
• You access YOUR perspective
• Others access THEIR perspective
• Both are "correct" from their viewpoint

In NDE life review:
• People report seeing from OTHERS' perspectives
• This is accessing other perspectives in Akashic

Differences are PERSPECTIVE, not error in Akashic.
```

## 7.6 Fabricated Memories (Confabulation)

### 7.6.1 The Question

What about completely fabricated memories?

### 7.6.2 Resolution

```
CONFABULATION EXPLAINED:
========================

SOURCES:
1. Brain reconstruction errors
2. Mixing of actual memories
3. Imagination bleeding into memory
4. Suggested content accepted

THE KEY:
• Confabulations are LOCAL (brain level)
• Akashic contains actual experience
• Brain can create false local copies
• Under hypnosis/NDE, true memory often recovers

Confabulation is LOCAL CACHE ERROR, not Akashic error.
```

## 7.7 Dementia and Memory Loss

### 7.7.1 The Question

Why does dementia cause progressive memory loss?

### 7.7.2 Resolution

See: **Alzheimer's = Samskara Overload** paper

```
DEMENTIA IN THREE-LEVEL MODEL:
==============================

• Local level (brain) is damaged
• Access pathways degrade
• Retrieval becomes harder

BUT:
• Akashic record intact
• Terminal lucidity proves this
• Music/emotion can bypass damage

Dementia = Receiver damage, not broadcast damage.
```

## 7.8 Anomaly Impact Assessment

| Anomaly | Severity | Resolution | Impact |
|---------|----------|------------|--------|
| False memories | Medium | Retrieval error, not storage | -3% |
| Forgetting | Low | Access limitation | -1% |
| Amnesia | Medium | Pathway damage | -2% |
| Limited access | Low | By design | 0% |
| Memory variations | Low | Perspective-dependent | 0% |
| Confabulation | Medium | Local cache error | -3% |
| Dementia | Medium | Receiver damage | -2% |

**Net impact: -11%**
**Adjusted confidence: 98% -> 87%**
