## 1.1 THE CORE PARADOX

When a person dies, observers note a profound mystery:

```
OBSERVATION: Body looks perfectly fine
REALITY: Person is dead

QUESTION: What left? Why can't we see it leaving?
```

This paper proposes that death is not a single event but a **multi-level cascade** that unfolds from subtle to gross levels. The visible "death" is merely the final step in a process that began hours or days earlier at invisible levels.

## 1.2 THE RESEARCH QUESTION

**Primary Question:** Why does death appear "sudden" when the body shows no visible damage?

**Secondary Questions:**
1. What is the sequence of events during death?
2. Why can't observers witness consciousness departing?
3. How do physical, energetic, and consciousness levels interact during death?
4. What is the relationship between Atman (consciousness) and Prana (life force)?

## 1.3 THE MULTI-LEVEL HYPOTHESIS

We propose that death unfolds across six fractal levels:

| Level | Name | What Leaves | Visibility |
|-------|------|-------------|------------|
| N-5 | Consciousness (Atman) | Pure awareness | INVISIBLE |
| N-4 | Life Force (Prana) | Breath/energy | INVISIBLE |
| N-3 | Subtle Body | Mind/personality | INVISIBLE |
| N-2 | Organs | Function | Internal |
| N-1 | Cells | Metabolism | Microscopic |
| N | Physical Body | Structure | VISIBLE |

**Key Insight:** Observers at Level N can only see Level N processes. They miss the preceding five levels.

## 1.4 SIGNIFICANCE

Understanding death as a multi-level process:

1. **Explains the paradox** — Why body looks fine when person is "gone"
2. **Validates near-death experiences** — Consciousness separates before physical death
3. **Informs end-of-life care** — How to support the dying process
4. **Resolves medical puzzles** — Why CPR sometimes works and sometimes doesn't
5. **Bridges science and wisdom traditions** — Vedic death mechanics validated
