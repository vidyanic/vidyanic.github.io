(0-25)   (25-50)    (50-75)     (75-100)       (Death)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Vitality: 100% ->   75%   ->   50%   ->   25%   ->    0%
Dharma:    4/4  ->   3/4   ->   2/4   ->   1/4   ->    0
Sattva:   High  ->  Medium ->   Low   ->  V.Low ->   Gone
Prana:    Full  ->  Strong ->  Weak   ->  Faint ->   Left

DEATH SEQUENCE (WITH INTERNAL SUN STATUS):
===========================================

T-72 hours:  Atman begins withdrawal (Level N-5)
             +- INTERNAL SUN: 100% -> 80% (dimming starts)
             +- Person becomes quiet, introspective
             +- Dreams intensify
             +- No appetite (sun can't process food)

T-24 hours:  Prana withdrawal accelerates (Level N-4)
             +- INTERNAL SUN: 80% -> 20% (critical dim)
             +- Appetite vanishes completely
             +- Energy very low
             +- Fire element (Agni) fading

T-6 hours:   Prana concentrates at exit point (Level N-4)
             +- INTERNAL SUN: 20% -> 5% (nearly dark)
             +- Extremities cold (no metabolic heat)
             +- Skin pale (no circulation)
             +- Body heavy (Earth element dissolving)

T-1 hour:    Subtle body preparing exit (Level N-3)
             +- INTERNAL SUN: 5% -> 1% (last flickers)
             +- Consciousness fading
             +- Past memories surface (life review)
             +- Person may say: "I see a light"

T-15 min:    Final Prana concentration (Level N-4)
             +- INTERNAL SUN: 1% -> 0.2% (dying)
             +- Breathing irregular (Cheyne-Stokes)
             +- Unresponsive

T-5 min:     Subtle body exits (Level N-3)
             +- INTERNAL SUN: 0.2% -> 0.02%
             +- LAST BREATH = PRANA EXITS
             +- Silver cord breaks

T-0:         DECLARED DEAD (Level N-2)
             +- INTERNAL SUN: COMPLETELY EXTINGUISHED (0%)
             +- Heart stops (no Prana to pump)
             +- Brain activity ceases
             [Atman withdrew 72 hours ago!]
             [Last breath was PRANA leaving, not Atman]

T+4 min:     Brain cells dying (Level N-1)
T+20 min:    Heart cells dying (Level N-1)
T+2 hours:   Rigor mortis begins (Level N)
T+24 hours:  Most cells dead (Level N-1)
T+3 days:    Visible decay starts (Level N)

## APPENDIX B: ELEMENT DISSOLUTION COMPARISON

### Tibetan vs Backend Framework

| Tibetan Stage | Backend Level | Physical Sign | Subjective Experience |
|---------------|---------------|---------------|----------------------|
| Earth dissolves | Pranamaya 80% | Body feels heavy | "Sinking" feeling |
| Water dissolves | Pranamaya 50% | Dry mouth, no tears | "Drying up" feeling |
| Fire dissolves | Pranamaya 20% | Body temperature drops | "Going cold" |
| Air dissolves | Pranamaya 5% | Breathing irregular | "Can't breathe" |
| Space dissolves | Atman departing | Consciousness fades | "Expanding" feeling |

## APPENDIX C: EXIT POINT CHARACTERISTICS

| Exit Point | Chakra | Karma Quality | Next Birth |
|------------|--------|---------------|------------|
| Crown (Sahasrara) | Top of head | Moksha-ready | No rebirth / Liberation |
| Third Eye (Ajna) | Forehead | Advanced practice | Conscious choice |
| Throat (Vishuddha) | Throat | Creative karma | Higher realms |
| Heart (Anahata) | Chest | Devotional karma | Heavenly realms |
| Navel (Manipura) | Solar plexus | Mixed karma | Human realm |
| Sacral (Svadhisthana) | Lower abdomen | Desire karma | Challenging birth |
| Root (Muladhara) | Base of spine | Heavy karma | Difficult conditions |

## APPENDIX D: NDE ELEMENTS MAPPED TO MODEL

| NDE Element | Model Explanation |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Out-of-body experience | Atman/subtle body separation from physical |
| Tunnel | Transition through levels |
| Light | Internal Sun or higher realm perception |
| Life review | Consciousness accessing all memories |
| Deceased relatives | Subtle body meeting other subtle bodies |
| Sense of peace | Atman's natural state (beyond suffering) |
| Return to body | Re-connection if karma not exhausted |

## APPENDIX F: FORMULAS

### Prana Generation

```
P_prana = A_connection × Sun_Efficiency × [(Dharma × Sattva) / (Rajas + 2×Tamas)]

WHERE:
A_connection ∈ [0,1] — Connection of consciousness to body
Sun_Efficiency ∈ [0,1] — Internal sun converter efficiency
Dharma ∈ [0,1] — Alignment with universal law
Sattva, Rajas, Tamas — Guna proportions (sum to 1)
```

### Time Dilation During Death

```
L_m = (D × S) / (R + 2T)

As Sattva increases during death transition:
L_m -> ∞ (subjective time expands)

This is why life review can happen in "seconds"
```

### Confidence Score

```
Confidence = (E_nde × 0.25) + (E_hospice × 0.25) + (E_tradition × 0.20) + (L_internal × 0.15) + (L_falsification × 0.15)

Result: 92%
```
