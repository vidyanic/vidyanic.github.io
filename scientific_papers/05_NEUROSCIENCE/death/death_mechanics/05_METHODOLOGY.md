# 05. METHODOLOGY — Validation Approaches

---

## 5.1 DATA SOURCES

### 5.1.1 Near-Death Experience Studies

| Study | Sample Size | Key Contribution |
|-------|-------------|------------------|
| AWARE I (Parnia, 2014) | 2,060 | Verified perception during cardiac arrest |
| van Lommel (2001) | 344 | NDEs with documented zero brain activity |
| Greyson Scale Database | 5,000+ | Standardized NDE characteristics |
| IANDS Archive | 4,000+ | Cross-cultural NDE reports |

### 5.1.2 Hospice and End-of-Life Studies

- Terminal lucidity documentation
- Pre-death vision reports
- Behavioral changes before death
- Caregiver observations

### 5.1.3 Clinical Death Records

- CPR outcome data
- Time-to-intervention vs success rates
- Unexplained survival/failure cases

### 5.1.4 Vedic/Buddhist Death Texts

- Tibetan Book of the Dead (Bardo Thodol)
- Garuda Purana (death mechanics)
- Katha Upanishad (Atman departure)

## 5.2 ANALYTICAL METHODS

### 5.2.1 Pattern Analysis

Compare predicted death sequence with documented cases:

```
PREDICTED SEQUENCE:
T-72h: Consciousness changes (detachment, clarity)
T-24h: Energy changes (appetite loss, fatigue)
T-6h:  Physical changes (cold extremities, pallor)
T-0:   Clinical death (heart stops, no breathing)
```

**Method:** Timeline reconstruction from hospice records

### 5.2.2 NDE Verification

Assess accuracy of out-of-body perceptions:

```
CRITERIA:
1. Perception occurred during documented clinical death
2. Perception includes verifiable details
3. No normal sensory pathway available
```

**Method:** Cross-reference NDE reports with medical records

### 5.2.3 CPR Outcome Analysis

Test H₃ (consciousness determines success):

```
VARIABLES:
- Time to intervention
- Quality of CPR
- Patient age/health
- *Pre-arrest behavior* (new variable)
```

**Method:** Retrospective analysis of CPR outcome predictors

### 5.2.4 Cross-Tradition Comparison

Validate fractal consistency:

```
SOURCES:
- Vedic (Pancha Kosha, Atman-Prana)
- Tibetan (Element dissolution, Bardo)
- Egyptian (Ka, Ba departure)
- Western (NDE, terminal experiences)
```

**Method:** Structural mapping across traditions

## 5.3 VALIDATION FRAMEWORK

### Multi-Dimensional Scoring

| Dimension | Weight | Criteria |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| NDE Evidence | 25% | Verified perceptions during clinical death |
| Hospice Data | 25% | Behavioral changes match predicted sequence |
| Clinical Correlation | 20% | CPR outcomes align with consciousness model |
| Cross-Tradition | 15% | Consistent across cultures |
| Internal Logic | 15% | No contradictions in framework |

### Confidence Calculation

```
Confidence = Σ(Weight_i × Score_i)

WHERE:
Score_i ∈ [0.0, 1.0] for each dimension
```

---

## 5.4 LIMITATIONS

1. **Consciousness is invisible** — Cannot directly observe Atman departure
2. **Subjective reports** — NDEs cannot be experimentally induced safely
3. **Post-hoc analysis** — Death cannot be repeated for verification
4. **Selection bias** — Only survivors can report NDEs

### Mitigation

- Use multiple independent data sources
- Focus on verifiable aspects (accurate perceptions)
- Triangulate across traditions
- Acknowledge uncertainty in confidence scores
