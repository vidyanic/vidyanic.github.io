# 04. HYPOTHESES — Testable Predictions

---

## 4.1 PRIMARY HYPOTHESIS

**H₁: Death is a multi-level cascade, not a single event**

Death unfolds across six fractal levels (N-5 to N) over hours to days, with visible death being the final stage.

### Testable Predictions

| Prediction | Test |
|------------|------|
| Consciousness changes precede physical death | Monitor behavior/awareness 72+ hours before |
| Energy (Prana) withdraws before organs fail | Measure metabolic changes pre-mortem |
| Physical death is observable; consciousness departure is not | Compare observer reports with clinical data |

## 4.2 SECONDARY HYPOTHESES

### H₂: Atman withdraws before Prana exits

**Prediction:** The person will show signs of "departure" (detachment, life review, unusual clarity) days before clinical death.

**Evidence:**
- Terminal lucidity phenomenon
- Pre-death dreams and visions
- Reported sense of "already leaving"

### H₃: CPR success depends on consciousness state, not just timing

**Prediction:** CPR will fail if Atman has fully withdrawn, regardless of how quickly initiated.

**Evidence:**
- Unexplained CPR failures with immediate response
- Unexplained CPR successes with delayed response
- NDE reports of "choosing to return"

### H₄: Near-death experiences occur during consciousness-body separation

**Prediction:** NDEs represent the Atman/Prana separation phase (Level N-4 to N-3).

**Evidence:**
- NDEs during zero brain activity (van Lommel, Parnia studies)
- Accurate perception during clinical death
- Cross-cultural consistency of NDE elements

### H₅: The "Internal Sun" dims in predictable sequence

**Prediction:** Measurable energy production (metabolism) will decline in a specific pattern matching the Guna degradation formula.

**Evidence:**
- Temperature drop follows predictable curve
- Appetite loss precedes physical decline
- Energy subjectively felt as "fading" by dying

## 4.3 NULL HYPOTHESES

**H₀₁:** Death is instantaneous — consciousness and body stop simultaneously.

**H₀₂:** CPR success is purely mechanical — depends only on timing and technique.

**H₀₃:** NDEs are hallucinations — generated by dying brain, not real perceptions.

**H₀₄:** Consciousness = brain activity — no separation possible.

---

## 4.4 FALSIFICATION CRITERIA

The multi-level death model would be falsified if:

1. No behavioral/awareness changes precede physical death
2. NDE perceptions are consistently inaccurate
3. CPR success is perfectly predicted by timing alone
4. No metabolic changes precede organ failure
5. Consciousness can be maintained indefinitely by keeping brain alive
