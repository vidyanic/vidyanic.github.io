# 02. LITERATURE REVIEW — Death Studies Across Disciplines

## 2.1 MEDICAL PERSPECTIVES

### Clinical Death Definition

Modern medicine defines death as:

```
CLINICAL DEATH:
- Cessation of heartbeat
- Cessation of breathing
- Absence of brain activity (EEG flat)
- No response to stimuli
```

**Problem:** This definition treats death as a binary event, ignoring the process.

### Resuscitation Research

- **CPR success rates:** 10-40% depending on timing
- **Why it fails:** Unknown — even when started immediately
- **Proposed:** Consciousness may have already departed

**Reference:** Parnia et al. (2014). AWARE Study — consciousness continues after clinical death.

## 2.2 NEAR-DEATH EXPERIENCE RESEARCH

### Key Findings

| Researcher | Year | Finding |
|------------|------|---------|
| Moody | 1975 | First systematic NDE documentation |
| Ring | 1980 | Cross-cultural consistency of NDEs |
| van Lommel | 2001 | NDEs during cardiac arrest (no brain activity) |
| Parnia | 2014 | Verified perception during clinical death |
| Greyson | 2021 | NDEs as evidence for consciousness beyond brain |

### Common NDE Elements

1. Floating above body (out-of-body experience)
2. Moving through tunnel
3. Encountering light
4. Life review
5. Meeting deceased relatives
6. Sense of peace
7. Reluctance to return

**Key Question:** If consciousness = brain activity, how do NDEs occur during zero brain activity?

## 2.3 TIBETAN DEATH TRADITIONS

### Bardo Thodol (Tibetan Book of the Dead)

Documents death as a **49-day process** across multiple bardos (intermediate states):

1. **Chikhai Bardo** — Moment of death, clear light
2. **Chonyid Bardo** — Experience of deities/visions
3. **Sidpa Bardo** — Seeking rebirth

**Key Insight:** Death is not instant but a gradual transition across states.

### Dissolution of Elements

Tibetan tradition describes the dissolution of five elements:

1. Earth dissolves -> Body becomes heavy
2. Water dissolves -> Dryness, no tears
3. Fire dissolves -> Body temperature drops
4. Air dissolves -> Breathing irregular
5. Space dissolves -> Consciousness fades

**Correlation:** Matches observable clinical signs of dying.

## 2.4 VEDIC DEATH MECHANICS

### Pancha Kosha Model

Death involves withdrawal from five sheaths:

```
ATMAN (Consciousness) withdraws from:
1. Anandamaya Kosha (Bliss)
2. Vijnanamaya Kosha (Intellect)
3. Manomaya Kosha (Mind)
4. Pranamaya Kosha (Energy) <- Prana exits here
5. Annamaya Kosha (Physical body)
```

### Atman vs Prana Distinction

| Aspect | Atman | Prana |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Nature | Pure consciousness | Life force/energy |
| Quality | Nirguna (without qualities) | Saguna (with qualities) |
| Timing | Withdraws days before | Exits at last breath |
| Visibility | Completely invisible | Breath observable |
| Sanskrit | आत्मन् (Bindu) | प्राण (Om sound) |

**Reference:** Katha Upanishad, Taittiriya Upanishad, Prashna Upanishad

## 2.5 BIOLOGICAL DEATH SEQUENCE

### Cellular Death Timeline

| Time After Death | Process |
|------------------|---------|
| 0-4 minutes | Brain cells begin dying |
| 4-6 minutes | Irreversible brain damage |
| 15-20 minutes | Heart cells die |
| 2-6 hours | Rigor mortis begins |
| 24 hours | Most cells dead |
| 3+ days | Visible decomposition |

### Energy Cascade

1. Heart stops -> No oxygen circulation
2. Mitochondria stop -> No ATP production
3. Ion pumps fail -> Cellular integrity lost
4. Lysosomes release -> Self-digestion begins

**Key Insight:** Physical death is the final stage, not the first.

## 2.6 GAP IN LITERATURE

Current research lacks:

1. **Integrated model** spanning consciousness -> biology
2. **Explanation for timing** — Why CPR works sometimes
3. **Resolution of NDE paradox** — Consciousness without brain activity
4. **Mechanistic framework** — How levels interact

**This paper addresses these gaps** through the multi-level fractal model.
