# ☯️ DEATH MECHANICS — Multi-Level Decay Process

> **"न जायते म्रियते वा कदाचित्"**
> "The soul is never born, nor does it die at any time."

## ❓ QUESTIONS ANSWERED

1. **Why do humans die?**
   -> Atman (consciousness) withdraws when karma for this life is exhausted

2. **Why does the body look fine when person is "gone"?**
   -> Death happens subtle -> gross; visible death is the LAST step

3. **Why can't we see consciousness leaving?**
   -> Rendering Law: No level can observe its own substrate

4. **What's the difference between Atman and Prana?**
   -> Atman = consciousness (bindu); Prana = life force (Om/breath)

5. **Why does CPR sometimes work and sometimes fail?**
   -> Depends on consciousness state, not just timing

## 📊 QUICK SUMMARY

```
THE DEATH CASCADE (Subtle -> Gross):
===================================

Level N-5: ATMAN withdraws      (72 hours before)  — INVISIBLE
Level N-4: PRANA collapses      (24 hours before)  — INVISIBLE
Level N-3: SUBTLE BODY exits    (6 hours before)   — INVISIBLE
Level N-2: ORGANS fail          (minutes before)   — INTERNAL
Level N-1: CELLS die            (after death)      — MICROSCOPIC
Level N:   BODY decays          (hours-days after) — VISIBLE

OBSERVERS ONLY SEE LEVEL N!
