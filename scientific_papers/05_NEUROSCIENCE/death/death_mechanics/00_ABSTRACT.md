## Research Question

What is the mechanism of death according to Backend Architecture, and how does it match observations?

---

## Hypothesis

**H₁:** Death is the sequential dissolution of Koshas (sheaths), beginning with Atman withdrawal and ending with body decay.

---

## Key Findings

| Phase | Physical | Backend |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Pre-death (days) | Subtle changes | Atman withdrawal |
| Active dying (hours) | Organ shutdown | Kosha collapse |
| Clinical death | Heart/brain stop | Prana exit |
| Post-mortem | Decay | Annamaya → elements |

---

## Backend Correlation

| Death Feature | Backend Mechanism |
|---------------|-------------------|
| "Knowing" death approaches | Atman prepares exit |
| Peaceful vs struggling | Guna state at death |
| Last words/thoughts | Antya-Smriti |
| Body decomposition | Pancha Mahabhuta return |

## Confidence Score
