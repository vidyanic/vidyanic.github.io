# 2. Literature Review

## 2.1 Foundational Epigenetics Research

### 2.1.1 Waddington (1942)

Conrad Waddington coined "epigenetics" — the study of how genes interact with environment to produce phenotype.

### 2.1.2 DNA Methylation Discovery

- 1948: Methylated cytosine discovered
- 1975: Riggs & Holliday propose methylation silences genes
- 1980s-present: Mechanism elucidated

## 2.2 Transgenerational Inheritance Studies

### 2.2.1 Dutch Hunger Winter (1944-1945)

**Context:** Nazi blockade caused famine in Netherlands

**Findings:**
| Generation | Effect |
|------------|--------|
| Mothers (exposed) | Metabolic changes |
| Children (F1) | Higher obesity, diabetes |
| Grandchildren (F2) | Still showing effects |

**Significance:** Famine experience encoded in epigenome, transmitted across generations.

### 2.2.2 Holocaust Survivor Studies

**Yehuda et al. (2016):**
- Holocaust survivors show altered cortisol regulation
- Their children show same alterations
- Not explained by behavior — epigenetic transmission

### 2.2.3 Swedish Överkalix Study

**Bygren et al.:**
- Food availability of grandparents affected grandchildren's longevity
- Grandfather's food surplus -> Grandson's shorter life
- Grandfather's famine -> Grandson's longer life

## 2.3 Meditation and Epigenetics

### 2.3.1 Kaliman et al. (2014)

**Study:** 8-hour mindfulness meditation

**Finding:** Experienced meditators showed:
- Reduced RIPK2 expression
- Reduced COX2 expression
- Altered histone modifications

**Significance:** Single day of meditation produces epigenetic changes.

### 2.3.2 Chaix et al. (2017)

**Study:** Long-term meditators vs controls

**Finding:**
- Meditators show different methylation patterns
- Particularly in stress-response genes
- More "youthful" epigenetic age

## 2.4 Epigenetic Reprogramming

### 2.4.1 Natural Reprogramming

Epigenetic marks are largely erased:
- During gametogenesis (sperm/egg formation)
- After fertilization (early embryo)

**BUT:** Some marks escape — particularly imprinted genes and certain stress marks.

### 2.4.2 Environmental Influence

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Diet | Methyl donors affect methylation |
| Stress | Activates stress genes |
| Exercise | Positive epigenetic changes |
| Toxins | Can cause aberrant methylation |

## 2.5 Backend Documentation on Samskaras

### 2.5.1 Yoga Sutras

**Patanjali (II.12-14):**
> "The karmic storehouse (Karmashaya) is the root of Samskaras, experienced in present or future lives."

### 2.5.2 Key Concepts

| Term | Meaning | Epigenetic Parallel |
|------|---------|---------------------|
| Samskara | Mental impression | Epigenetic mark |
| Vasana | Latent tendency | Expression pattern |
| Chitta | Mind-stuff | Epigenome |
| Karmashaya | Karma storehouse | Heritable epigenome |
| Samskara Shuddhi | Impression purification | Reprogramming |

---

## 2.6 Summary

| Research Area | Key Finding | Samskara Parallel |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| DNA methylation | Marks control expression | Samskaras control behavior |
| Transgenerational | Marks inherited | Karma transmitted |
| Meditation | Practice changes marks | Sadhana purifies Samskaras |
| Reprogramming | Marks can be cleared | Samskara Shuddhi possible |
