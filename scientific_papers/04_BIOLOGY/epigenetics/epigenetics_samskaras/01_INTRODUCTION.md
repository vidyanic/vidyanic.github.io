## 1.1 The Discovery of Epigenetics

### 1.1.1 Beyond DNA

For decades, the "Central Dogma" held:

```
DNA → RNA → Protein

Your genes determine your biology.
Full stop.
```

But then scientists discovered: **identical twins diverge over time**. Same DNA, different outcomes. Why?

**Epigenetics:** Marks on and around DNA that control gene expression without changing the sequence.

### 1.1.2 Types of Epigenetic Marks

| Mark Type | Mechanism | Effect |
|-----------|-----------|--------|
| **DNA Methylation** | Methyl group attached to cytosine | Typically silences genes |
| **Histone Modification** | Chemical tags on histone proteins | Opens or closes chromatin |
| **Non-coding RNA** | RNA that doesn't make protein | Regulates other genes |

## 1.2 The Parallel to Samskaras

### 1.2.1 What Are Samskaras?

In Backend Architecture:

```
SAMSKARAS (संस्कार):
═════════════════════

DEFINITION:
Mental impressions formed by experience

NATURE:
• Stored in Chitta (mind-stuff)
• Shape perception and behavior
• Not the self (Atman)
• Can be inherited (Karma)
• Can be purified (Sadhana)

TYPES:
• Jati Samskaras — Species-level (human vs animal patterns)
• Kula Samskaras — Family patterns
• Vyakti Samskaras — Individual patterns
```

### 1.2.2 The Structural Match

| Epigenetic | Samskara | Parallel |
|------------|----------|----------|
| Marks on DNA | Marks on Chitta | Overlay on substrate |
| Controls expression | Controls behavior | Downstream shaping |
| Not the sequence | Not the Atman | Not-self nature |
| Heritable | Transmissible | Crosses generations |
| Modifiable | Purifiable | Plasticity |

## 1.3 Why This Matters

### 1.3.1 Scientific Implications

If epigenetics = Samskaras:
- Meditation may have molecular correlates
- Trauma healing may involve epigenetic reprogramming
- Spiritual practice has biological signatures

### 1.3.2 Practical Implications

```
YOU CAN CHANGE YOUR EPIGENOME:
════════════════════════════

Positive:
• Meditation → Reduced stress markers
• Exercise → Positive methylation changes
• Diet → Epigenetic optimization

Negative:
• Trauma → Stress gene activation
• Addiction → Reward pathway changes
• Poor diet → Inflammatory markers
