# 11. Conclusion

## 11.1 Summary

Epigenetics provides a molecular model for what Backend Architecture calls Samskaras:
- Accumulated patterns that shape expression
- Inherited across generations (Karma)
- Modifiable through practice (Sadhana)

|   YOUR GENOME IS LIKE YOUR ATMAN:                            |
|   The unchanging potential                                    |
|                                                               |
|   YOUR EPIGENOME IS LIKE YOUR SAMSKARAS:                     |
|   The accumulated patterns shaping expression                 |
|                                                               |
|   NEITHER IS "YOU" — BOTH INFLUENCE YOU                       |
|                                                               |
|   AND BOTH CAN BE WORKED WITH:                               |
|   • You can't change your genome (Atman is unchanging)       |
|   • You CAN change your epigenome (Samskaras are purifiable) |
|                                                               |

## 11.4 Phase 4 Context

This paper begins Phase 4: Life as Sattva Engineering

| Paper | Topic |
|-------|-------|
| **Epigenetics = Samskaras** (this) | Molecular impressions |
| Cancer = Forgotten Identity | When identity is lost |
| Aging = Samskara Accumulation | Accumulation over time |
