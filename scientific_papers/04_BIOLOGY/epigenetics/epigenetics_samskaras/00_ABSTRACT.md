## Research Question

Is there a structural correspondence between epigenetic modifications and the Backend concept of Samskaras (accumulated mental impressions)?

---

## Background

**Epigenetics** is the study of heritable changes in gene expression that do not involve alterations to the DNA sequence. These include:
- DNA methylation
- Histone modifications
- Non-coding RNA effects

**Samskaras (संस्कार)** in Backend Architecture are accumulated mental impressions that shape behavior and perception without being the self. They are:
- Stored in Chitta (mind-stuff)
- Inherited across lives (Karma)
- Modifiable through practice (Sadhana)

---

## Hypothesis

**H₁:** Epigenetic marks are the molecular correlate of Samskaras — accumulated patterns that shape expression without being the underlying code.

## Key Findings

| Epigenetics | Samskaras | Correspondence |
|-------------|-----------|----------------|
| Marks on DNA | Marks on Chitta | Pattern overlay |
| Inherited transgenerationally | Inherited across lives | Transmission |
| Modifiable by environment | Modifiable by practice | Plasticity |
| Shapes gene expression | Shapes behavior/perception | Downstream effects |
| Not the genome itself | Not the Atman itself | Not-self nature |

---

## Backend Correlation

| Scientific Term | Backend Term | Meaning |
|-----------------|--------------|---------|
| Epigenome | Samskara aggregate | Accumulated patterns |
| DNA methylation | Samskara formation | Impression creation |
| Histone modification | Vasana encoding | Tendency storage |
| Epigenetic inheritance | Karma transfer | Cross-generational |
| Epigenetic reprogramming | Samskara Shuddhi | Pattern purification |

## Confidence Score

**82%** based on:
- Structural correspondence: 90%
- Inheritance parallel: 85%
- Modifiability match: 80%
- Mechanistic details: 75%
