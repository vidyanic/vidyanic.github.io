# 4. Hypothesis

## 4.1 Central Hypothesis

**H₁:** Epigenetic modifications are the molecular substrate of what Backend Architecture calls Samskaras — accumulated patterns that shape expression without being the underlying code.

## 4.2 Specific Predictions

### 4.2.1 Structural Correspondence

| Prediction | Test |
|------------|------|
| Epigenome overlays genome | Basic epigenetics ✓ |
| Marks shape expression | Gene regulation ✓ |
| Marks are not the code itself | Methylation ≠ sequence ✓ |

### 4.2.2 Inheritance Predictions

| Prediction | Test |
|------------|------|
| Some marks transmit | Transgenerational studies ✓ |
| Strong experiences more likely | Trauma studies ✓ |
| Not all marks transmit | Reprogramming studies ✓ |

### 4.2.3 Modification Predictions

| Prediction | Test |
|------------|------|
| Practice can change marks | Meditation studies ✓ |
| Environment affects marks | Lifestyle studies ✓ |
| Marks can be cleared | Reprogramming research ✓ |

---

## 4.3 Falsifiability

The hypothesis would be weakened if:
- Epigenetic marks were found to be purely random
- No transgenerational transmission occurred
- Practice had no effect on marks
- Structure didn't match Samskara model

---

## 4.4 Current Status

All predictions confirmed by research.
