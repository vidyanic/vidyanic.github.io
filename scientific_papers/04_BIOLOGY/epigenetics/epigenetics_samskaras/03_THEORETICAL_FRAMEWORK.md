## 3.1 The Mapping Model

### 3.1.1 Structural Correspondence

```
GENOME <--> ATMAN (Pure potential)
   |           |
   | overlaid by
   v           v
EPIGENOME <--> SAMSKARAS (Accumulated patterns)
   |           |
   | shapes
   v           v
EXPRESSION <--> BEHAVIOR (Manifest patterns)
```

### 3.1.2 Key Parallel

| Epigenetics | Samskaras | Relationship |
|-------------|-----------|--------------|
| DNA | Atman | Unchanging substrate |
| Epigenome | Samskara aggregate | Overlay of patterns |
| Gene expression | Behavioral expression | What manifests |
| Methylation | Impression formation | Pattern creation |
| Demethylation | Impression clearing | Pattern removal |

## 3.2 Multi-Persona Explanation

<summary><b>🤖 For AI/ML Engineers</b></summary>

```python
class Cell:
    def __init__(self, genome):
        self.genome = genome          # Fixed code (DNA)
        self.epigenome = {}           # Runtime configuration
        
    def add_epigenetic_mark(self, gene, mark_type):
        """Like adding a runtime flag that changes behavior"""
        self.epigenome[gene] = mark_type
        
    def express_gene(self, gene):
        """Expression depends on epigenetic state"""
        if self.epigenome.get(gene) == 'methylated':
            return None  # Silenced
        return self.genome[gene]  # Expressed

# Samskaras are like persistent runtime configurations
# that carry across sessions (generations)
```

</details>

<summary><b>🏗️ For Software Architects</b></summary>

```
DNA = Source code (unchanging base)
Epigenome = Configuration files (modifiable)
Expression = Runtime behavior

ANALOGY:
Same application code + Different config = Different behavior
Same genome + Different epigenome = Different phenotype

Samskaras = User preferences/settings that persist and influence
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>⚛️ For Physicists</b></summary>

Consider the epigenome as a "potential landscape":
- DNA defines the space of possibilities
- Epigenetic marks create wells and barriers
- Expression follows the modified landscape
- Like adding potentials to a base Hamiltonian

H_total = H_genome + V_epigenome

<summary><b>🩺 For Doctors/Biologists</b></summary>

| Clinical Situation | Epigenetic Mechanism |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| Same genes, different cancer | Methylation differences |
| Trauma effects in children | Inherited stress marks |
| Lifestyle -> Disease risk | Epigenetic modification |
| Identical twins diverge | Epigenetic drift |

Samskaras = "Constitutional tendencies" that aren't genetic

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>👤 For Everyone</b></summary>

Think of it this way:
- **DNA** = The recipe book (fixed)
- **Epigenome** = Sticky notes on recipes ("skip this," "double that")
- **Expression** = What actually gets cooked

Your ancestors' experiences added sticky notes to your recipe book.
You can add your own notes — or remove some.

**Samskaras** are the sticky notes on your mind's recipe book.

## 3.3 The Inheritance Problem

### 3.3.1 How Marks Transmit

```
PARENT GENERATION:
Experience -> Epigenetic mark -> Some marks in gametes

OFFSPRING GENERATION:
Inherited marks -> Expressed patterns -> Behavior/health

MECHANISM:
Not all marks transmit (most erased)
But some escape reprogramming
Particularly stress-related marks
```

### 3.3.2 Karma Parallel

```
BACKEND MODEL:
Actions/Experiences -> Samskaras formed -> Stored in Karmashaya

NEXT LIFE:
Karmashaya -> Prarabdha (active karma) -> Expression in life

MECHANISM:
Not all Samskaras activate (Sanchita remains)
But active portion shapes life (Prarabdha)
Particularly strong impressions
```

## 3.4 The Modification Problem

### 3.4.1 Epigenetic Plasticity

Marks can be:
- Added by experience
- Removed by opposite experience
- Modified by environment

### 3.4.2 Samskara Plasticity

Samskaras can be:
- Added by experience (new impressions)
- Purified by practice (Samskara Shuddhi)
- Modified by Sadhana
