# 9. Discussion

## 9.1 Summary

Epigenetics and Samskaras show remarkable structural correspondence:
- Both overlay an unchanging substrate
- Both shape downstream expression
- Both inherit across generations
- Both can be modified through practice

---

## 9.2 Implications

### 9.2.1 For Science

- Mental practices may have molecular correlates
- Transgenerational trauma is real and measurable
- "Karma" may have biological substrate

### 9.2.2 For Medicine

- Epigenetic therapies align with ancient practices
- Lifestyle interventions work at molecular level
- Trauma healing may involve epigenetic reprogramming

### 9.2.3 For You

- Your ancestors' experiences are in your cells
- Your experiences shape your descendants
- Practice can change your epigenome

---

## 9.3 Limitations

- Correlation vs mechanism unclear
- Not all Samskaras may be epigenetic
- Epigenetics is molecular; Samskaras may be subtler

| Paper | Connection |
|-------|------------|
| Entropy = Tamas | Sattva maintains epigenetic order |
| Cancer = Forgotten Identity | Epigenetic dysfunction |
| Aging = Samskara Accumulation | Epigenetic clock |
