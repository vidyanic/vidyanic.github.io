# 7. Anomalies

## 7.1 Imprinted Genes

### 7.1.1 The Phenomenon

Some genes are expressed only from one parent's copy:
- Maternal imprinting: Only father's copy active
- Paternal imprinting: Only mother's copy active

### 7.1.2 Backend Interpretation

Some Samskaras are specifically from maternal or paternal lineage — "Pitru Karma" (ancestral karma) has gender-specific components.

## 7.2 Epigenetic Clock

### 7.2.1 The Phenomenon

Methylation patterns correlate with age — the "epigenetic clock" predicts biological age.

### 7.2.2 Backend Interpretation

Samskara accumulation over life — more impressions = older epigenetic age. See: [Aging = Samskara Accumulation](../../aging/aging_samskara/).

## 7.3 Cancer Epigenetics

### 7.3.1 The Phenomenon

Cancer cells show abnormal methylation patterns:
- Hypermethylation of tumor suppressors
- Hypomethylation of oncogenes

### 7.3.2 Backend Interpretation

Cancer = Forgotten identity = Loss of proper Samskara structure. See: [Cancer = Forgotten Identity](../../cancer/cancer_forgotten_identity/).
