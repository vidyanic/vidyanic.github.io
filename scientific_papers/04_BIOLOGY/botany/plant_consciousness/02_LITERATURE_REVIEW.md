# 2. LITERATURE REVIEW

---

## 2.1 Plant Signaling Research

### 2.1.1 Chemical Communication

**Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs):**
- Acacia trees warn neighbors of grazers
- Damaged plants release "distress" chemicals
- Neighbors upregulate defenses before attack
- Information transfer without physical contact

### 2.1.2 Electrical Signaling

**Action Potentials:**
- Similar to animal neurons
- Venus flytrap counts touches
- Signal travels at ~1 mm/s
- Triggers mechanical responses

### 2.1.3 Underground Networks

**Mycorrhizal Web (Simard, 2016):**
- Fungal networks connect trees
- Carbon/nutrient sharing
- Preferential resource allocation to kin
- "Mother tree" hypothesis

## 2.2 Plant Learning

### 2.2.1 Habituation

**Mimosa pudica (Gagliano, 2014):**
- Learns to ignore repeated non-harmful drops
- Memory persists for weeks
- Distinguishes drop from other stimuli
- First peer-reviewed plant learning evidence

### 2.2.2 Associative Learning

**Pavlovian conditioning (Gagliano, 2016):**
- Pea plants conditioned to associate stimuli
- Learned air flow = light location
- Grew toward predicted light source
- Demonstrates anticipation

### 2.2.3 Memory

**Stress memory:**
- Plants remember drought
- Faster response to subsequent stress
- Epigenetic changes persist
- "Prepare for past environment"

## 2.3 Plant Decision-Making

### 2.3.1 Resource Allocation

Plants make trade-off decisions:
- Growth vs. defense
- Root vs. shoot investment
- Seed production timing
- Optimal foraging for light/nutrients

### 2.3.2 Problem Solving

Root growth experiments:
- Navigate obstacles
- Find water by sound
- Avoid contaminated soil
- Optimize nutrient uptake

## 2.4 Consciousness Theories

### 2.4.1 Integrated Information Theory

**Tononi's IIT:**
- Consciousness = Integrated information (Φ)
- Present wherever information is integrated
- Plants have distributed information processing
- Possibility of plant Φ

### 2.4.2 Panpsychism

- Consciousness is fundamental property
- Present in degrees throughout nature
- Plants have simpler but real experience
- Aligns with Backend view

### 2.4.3 Global Workspace Theory

- Less applicable to plants
- Requires unified "workspace"
- Plants have distributed processing
- Different architecture, different consciousness

## 2.5 Backend Framework Sources

### 2.5.1 Sthavara Jiva

> **"स्थावराः क्षेत्रजाः वृक्षाः"**
> "Immobile, earth-born are trees."
> — Manusmriti

### 2.5.2 Consciousness in All

> **"सर्वं खल्विदं ब्रह्म"**
> "All this is indeed Brahman."
> — Chandogya Upanishad 3.14.1

### 2.5.3 2 Million Plant Yonis

From Padma Purana:
- Sthavara = 20 lakhs (2 million)
- Second largest category after animals
- Complete curriculum of immobile experience

## 2.6 Research Gaps

| Gap | Current Status | This Paper's Contribution |
|-----|----------------|--------------------------|
| Plant experience | Debated | Tamas-consciousness model |
| Mechanism | Unclear | Backend integration |
| Ethics implications | Unexplored | Jiva Yatra framework |
| Measurement | Limited | Guna-based assessment |
