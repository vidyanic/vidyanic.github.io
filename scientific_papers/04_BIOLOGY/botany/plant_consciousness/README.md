## 🎯 KEY QUESTION

**Do plants have consciousness? How does the Backend Framework's concept of Sthavara Jiva (immobile soul) correlate with emerging evidence of plant intelligence, communication, and awareness?**

|   • Show learning and memory (Mimosa, Venus flytrap)                     |
|   • Make "decisions" (resource allocation)                               |
|   • Feel "pain"? Respond to damage with signaling                        |

|   Plants are not "unconscious objects" —                                 |
|   They are Jivas in Tamas-dominant form.                                 |

## 📊 PLANT INTELLIGENCE EVIDENCE

### Communication

| Type | Mechanism | Example |
|------|-----------|---------|
| Chemical | VOCs | Acacia warns neighbors |
| Electrical | Action potentials | Venus flytrap counting |
| Underground | Mycorrhizal | "Wood Wide Web" |
| Sound | Vibration | Roots grow toward water |

### Learning

- Mimosa pudica habituates to repeated stimuli
- Plants remember drought and adjust
- Circadian anticipation without light cues
