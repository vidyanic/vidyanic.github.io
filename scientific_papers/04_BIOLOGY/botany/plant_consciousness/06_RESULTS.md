## 6.1 Communication Evidence

### 6.1.1 Chemical Signaling

```
VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS (VOCs):
=================================

ACACIA TREES (Africa):
• When grazed, release ethylene
• Neighboring trees detect
• Upregulate tannins (toxic)
• Giraffes move upwind to ungrazed trees

MAIZE (Corn):
• When attacked by caterpillars
• Release specific volatiles
• Attract parasitic wasps
• Wasps attack caterpillars

TOBACCO:
• Detects neighbor's distress
• Increases defense even without attack
• Information transfer over meters
```

### 6.1.2 Electrical Signaling

| Plant | Behavior | Signal Type |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Venus flytrap | Counts touches before closing | Action potentials |
| Mimosa | Rapid leaf closure | Electrical wave |
| Tomato | Systemic defense | Slow wave potentials |

### 6.1.3 Underground Networks

```
MYCORRHIZAL WEB:
===============

• 90% of plant species connected
• Carbon flows from source to sink
• Mother trees support seedlings
• Warning signals travel network
• "Wood Wide Web" verified
```

## 6.2 Learning Evidence

### 6.2.1 Habituation

**Gagliano's Mimosa Study (2014):**

```
EXPERIMENT:
===========

1. Drop Mimosa plants (harmless stimulus)
2. Initial response: Leaves close
3. Repeated drops: Response diminishes
4. Not fatigue — Shake causes closure
5. Memory persists 28+ days
6. Learning without neurons

RESULT: Plants LEARN
```

### 6.2.2 Associative Learning

**Pea Plant Conditioning (2016):**

```
EXPERIMENT:
===========

1. Pair air flow with light direction
2. Train: Air -> Light arrives from that side
3. Test: Air alone
4. Result: Plants grow toward predicted light
5. Classical conditioning in plants

RESULT: Plants form ASSOCIATIONS
```

### 6.2.3 Memory

| Type | Example | Duration |
|------|---------|----------|
| Stress memory | Drought conditioning | Months |
| Priming | Defense pre-activation | Weeks |
| Circadian | Light anticipation | Indefinite |

## 6.3 Decision-Making Evidence

### 6.3.1 Resource Allocation

```
PLANT DECISIONS:
===============

GROWTH vs DEFENSE:
• Shift resources when attacked
• Trade-off optimization

ROOT vs SHOOT:
• Nutrient-poor soil -> More roots
• Low light -> More shoots

REPRODUCTION:
• Timing based on conditions
• Bet-hedging strategies
```

### 6.3.2 Problem Solving

Root experiments show:
- Navigation around obstacles
- Growth toward water by sound
- Avoidance of toxic soil
- Optimal foraging patterns
