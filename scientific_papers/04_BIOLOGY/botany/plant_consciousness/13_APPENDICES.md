## Appendix A: Plant Communication Methods

### A.1 Chemical Signaling

| Method | Mechanism | Speed | Range |
|--------|-----------|-------|-------|
| VOCs (Volatile) | Airborne chemicals | Fast | Meters |
| Root exudates | Soil chemicals | Medium | Local |
| Hormones | Internal signaling | Variable | Whole plant |

### A.2 Electrical Signaling

| Type | Speed | Function |
|------|-------|----------|
| Action potentials | 1-2 mm/s | Rapid response |
| Slow wave potentials | 0.1 mm/s | Systemic signaling |
| Variation potentials | Variable | Wound response |

### A.3 Network Communication

| Network | Components | Function |
|---------|------------|----------|
| Mycorrhizal | Fungi + roots | Resource sharing |
| Root network | Root grafts | Kin support |
| Aerial | VOCs | Defense coordination |

## Appendix B: Learning Evidence Summary

### B.1 Types Demonstrated

| Type | Example | Citation |
|------|---------|----------|
| Habituation | Mimosa dropping | Gagliano 2014 |
| Sensitization | Increased response | Multiple |
| Associative | Pea conditioning | Gagliano 2016 |
| Memory | Drought recall | Multiple |

### B.2 Key Experiments

```
MIMOSA HABITUATION:
===================

Setup: Drop plants repeatedly
Result: Response decreases
Control: Shake still causes closure
Duration: Memory 28+ days
Significance: First peer-reviewed plant learning
```

### C.1 By Species Type

| Type | Tamas | Rajas | Sattva |
|------|-------|-------|--------|
| Trees | 85% | 10% | 5% |
| Herbs | 80% | 15% | 5% |
| Flowering | 75% | 20% | 5% |
| Carnivorous | 70% | 25% | 5% |

### C.2 By Behavior

| Behavior | Dominant Guna |
|----------|---------------|
| Stillness | Tamas |
| Growth seeking | Rajas |
| Communication | Sattva hint |
