# 7. ANOMALIES

## 7.1 Plant Behavior Anomalies

### 7.1.1 Venus Flytrap "Counting"

```
THE ANOMALY:
===========

Venus flytrap doesn't close on first touch.
Requires 2 touches within 20 seconds.
After closing, requires 5 more for digestion.

How does a plant without brain "count"?

STANDARD: Calcium accumulation threshold
BACKEND: Distributed processing (consciousness without brain)

Both explain mechanism; Backend adds meaning.
```

### 7.1.2 Dodder Host Selection

```
THE ANOMALY:
===========

Parasitic dodder plant:
• "Smells" potential hosts
• Grows toward nutritious ones
• Avoids low-quality hosts
• Makes "choices" without brain

IMPLICATION:
Decision-making without neurons.
Consciousness in simple form.
```

## 7.2 Network Anomalies

### 7.2.1 Warning Signal Speed

```
THE ANOMALY:
===========

Mother trees warn offspring via mycorrhizal network.
Signal travels faster than chemical diffusion explains.

POSSIBLE MECHANISM:
• Electrical signaling through network
• Fungal information processing
• Network has its own "intelligence"

BACKEND: Indrajal (all connected)
```

### 7.2.2 Kin Recognition

```
THE ANOMALY:
===========

Plants preferentially:
• Share resources with relatives
• Reduce root competition with kin
• Invest more in kin defense

How do they "know" who is related?

MECHANISM: Root exudates, chemical signatures
BACKEND: Jiva connection beyond physical
```

---

## 7.3 Consciousness Anomalies

### 7.3.1 Anesthesia Effects

```
THE ANOMALY:
===========

When anesthetized (ether, chloroform):
• Venus flytrap stops responding
• Mimosa leaves don't close
• Plant recovers after removal

Same drugs that anesthetize animals!

IMPLICATION:
Plants have "something to anesthetize."
Consciousness present to suppress.
```

### 7.3.2 Music and Growth

```
THE ANOMALY:
===========

Studies suggest plants respond to:
• Different music types
• Frequencies and vibrations
• "Preferring" certain sounds

Controversial but replicated in some studies.

BACKEND: Shabda (sound) affects all consciousness
```

---

## 7.4 Memory Anomalies

### 7.4.1 Transgenerational Memory

```
THE ANOMALY:
===========

Some evidence suggests:
• Stress "memory" passed to seeds
• Offspring "prepared" for parent's environment
• Epigenetic inheritance

MECHANISM: Epigenetics
BACKEND: Samskara inheritance (karmic patterns)
```

### 7.4.2 Circadian Without Cues

```
THE ANOMALY:
===========

Plants in constant darkness:
• Still maintain circadian rhythms
• Anticipate dawn and dusk
• Internal clock runs ~24 hours

Memory of day/night even without light.
```

## 7.5 How Backend Resolves

| Anomaly | Backend Resolution |
|---------|-------------------|
| Counting | Distributed Jiva processing |
| Host choice | Tamas-consciousness decides |
| Network speed | Indrajal connection |
| Kin recognition | Jiva-level awareness |
| Anesthesia | Consciousness present to suppress |
| Music response | Shabda affects all |
| Transgenerational | Samskara inheritance |
| Circadian | Rhythmic consciousness |

## 7.6 Remaining Questions

1. **Subjective experience** — What is it "like" to be a plant?
2. **Pain equivalent** — Do plants "suffer"?
3. **Pleasure equivalent** — Do plants experience wellbeing?
4. **Communication content** — How rich is plant "language"?

These remain open for research and contemplation.
