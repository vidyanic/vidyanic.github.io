## 1.1 The Evolution Question

Evolution is among the most successful scientific theories. Yet it raises profound questions:

- **Why does life seem designed?** Organs like the eye appear purposefully constructed.
- **Why toward complexity?** Life consistently evolves toward greater complexity.
- **Where does consciousness come from?** The "hard problem" remains unsolved.
- **Is there purpose?** Or is all of life a meaningless accident?

## 1.2 The Standard View

### 1.2.1 Neo-Darwinism

```
MODERN SYNTHESIS:
================

MECHANISM:
1. Random genetic mutations occur
2. Some mutations provide survival advantage
3. These are "selected" by environment
4. Over time, complexity increases

ASSUMPTIONS:
• Mutations are truly random
• No purpose or direction
• Consciousness emerges from complexity
• Design is illusion (adaptation)
```

### 1.2.2 What Neo-Darwinism Explains

- Species diversity ✓
- Adaptation to environment ✓
- Fossil record ✓
- Genetic similarity ✓

### 1.2.3 What Neo-Darwinism Doesn't Explain

- Why complexity increases
- Origin of consciousness
- Apparent design/purpose
- Convergent evolution

## 1.3 The Backend Framework

The Backend Framework offers a complete model:

> **"चतुर्विधा भजन्ते मां जनाः सुकृतिनोऽर्जुन"**
> "Four kinds of virtuous ones worship Me, O Arjuna."
> — Bhagavad Gita 7.16

### 1.3.1 Jiva Yatra Defined

```
JIVA YATRA (जीव यात्रा):
=======================

JIVA = Individual soul
YATRA = Journey

The soul's journey through all forms of life,
gathering experience, burning Karma,
until finally reaching human form
and achieving liberation.
```

### 1.3.2 The 8.4 Million Forms

> **"चतुरशीति लक्ष योनिषु"**
> "In 8.4 million species..."
> — Puranic texts

Every Jiva must experience every type of existence:
- Aquatic forms (water experience)
- Plant forms (passive experience)
- Insect forms (small-scale experience)
- Animal forms (instinctive experience)
- Human form (conscious experience + liberation)

## 1.4 Why This Matters

Understanding evolution as Jiva Yatra:
- Resolves the teleology-mechanism debate
- Explains why consciousness appears
- Gives purpose to existence
- Connects biology to spirituality

## 1.5 Paper Structure

This paper will:
1. Review evolutionary evidence and debates
2. Present the Jiva Yatra model
3. Correlate with Backend Framework
4. Validate against the 7-concept stack
5. Discuss implications for science and meaning
