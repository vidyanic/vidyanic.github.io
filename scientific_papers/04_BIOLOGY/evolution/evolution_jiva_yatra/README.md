|   84 LAKHS (8.4 MILLION) YONIS:                                          |
|   ============================                                            |
|   • Jiva (individual soul) must experience all forms                     |
|   • Each form = Learning experience                                      |
|   • Progression: Simple -> Complex -> Conscious                            |
|   • Final destination: Human (Manushya)                                  |
|                                                                           |
|   WHY HUMAN IS SPECIAL:                                                   |
|   ====================                                                    |
|   • All other species: EXPERIENCE Karma only                             |
|   • Humans: Can CREATE new Karma                                         |
|   • Only humans can achieve Moksha (liberation)                          |
|   • Human life = Gateway to exit                                         |
|                                                                           |
|   DARWIN WAS HALF RIGHT:                                                  |
|   • Natural selection is real (Dharma operates)                          |
|   • But PURPOSE drives it (Jiva seeking experience)                      |
|   • Random mutation? No — Guided by consciousness                        |
|                                                                           |
