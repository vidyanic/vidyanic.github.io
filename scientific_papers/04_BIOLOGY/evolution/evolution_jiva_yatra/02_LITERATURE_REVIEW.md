# 2. LITERATURE REVIEW

---

## 2.1 Classical Evolution Theory

### 2.1.1 Darwin (1859)

*On the Origin of Species*:
- Natural selection as mechanism
- Common descent
- Gradualism

### 2.1.2 Modern Synthesis (1930s-1940s)

Combined Darwin with Mendelian genetics:
- Dobzhansky, Mayr, Simpson, Huxley
- Random mutation as variation source
- Population genetics

### 2.1.3 Extended Synthesis (2000s-present)

Expanded to include:
- Epigenetics
- Developmental plasticity
- Niche construction
- Multilevel selection

## 2.2 Teleology Debates

### 2.2.1 Design Arguments

**Paley (1802):** Watchmaker argument — complex design implies designer.

**Behe (1996):** Irreducible complexity — some structures too complex for gradual evolution.

**Nagel (2012):** Mind and Cosmos — Neo-Darwinism incomplete for consciousness.

### 2.2.2 Anti-Teleology

**Dawkins (1986):** Blind Watchmaker — design is illusion from natural selection.

**Dennett (1995):** Darwin's Dangerous Idea — no purpose, only algorithm.

## 2.3 Consciousness and Evolution

### 2.3.1 The Hard Problem

**Chalmers (1996):** Why is there subjective experience? Evolution explains function, not experience.

### 2.3.2 Emergence vs Primacy

| View | Consciousness Is... |
|------|---------------------|
| Emergentism | Product of brain complexity |
| Panpsychism | Fundamental property of matter |
| Idealism | Primary; matter emerges from it |

### 2.3.3 Integrated Information Theory (Tononi)

- Consciousness = Integrated information (Φ)
- Present in degrees throughout nature
- Approaches Backend view (consciousness everywhere)

## 2.4 Convergent Evolution

### 2.4.1 Examples

| Structure | Independent Origins |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Eye | 40+ times |
| Wing | 4 times (insects, birds, bats, pterosaurs) |
| Echolocation | 2 times (bats, dolphins) |
| Camera eye | 2 times (vertebrates, cephalopods) |

### 2.4.2 Implication

If evolution is random, why do the same solutions appear repeatedly?
- Standard: "Limited design space"
- Jiva Yatra: "Dharma guides toward optimal forms"

## 2.5 Backend Framework Sources

### 2.5.1 8.4 Million Yonis

> **"जलजा नवलक्षाणि स्थावरा लक्षविंशति।
> कृमयो रुद्रसंख्याकाः पक्षिणां दशलक्षणम्।
> त्रिंशल्लक्षाणि पशवः चतुर्लक्षाणि मानुषाः।"**
> 
> "Aquatic: 900,000; Plants: 2,000,000;
> Insects: 1,100,000; Birds: 1,000,000;
> Animals: 3,000,000; Humans: 400,000."
> — Padma Purana

### 2.5.2 Jiva's Journey

> **"बहूनि मे व्यतीतानि जन्मानि तव चार्जुन"**
> "Many births of Mine have passed, and yours too, O Arjuna."
> — Bhagavad Gita 4.5

## 2.6 Research Gaps

| Gap | Current Status | This Paper's Contribution |
|-----|----------------|--------------------------|
| Teleology | Debated | Jiva Yatra resolves |
| Consciousness origin | Unsolved | Consciousness primary |
| Direction of evolution | Unexplained | Purpose-driven |
| Human uniqueness | Debated | Karma-creation capacity |
