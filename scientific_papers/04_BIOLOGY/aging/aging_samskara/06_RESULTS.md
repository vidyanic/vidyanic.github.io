## 6.1 Epigenetic Clock Evidence

| Clock | Tissue | Accuracy | Interpretation |
|-------|--------|----------|----------------|
| Horvath | Pan-tissue | ±3.6 years | Universal Samskara counter |
| Hannum | Blood | ±4.9 years | Blood Samskara |
| GrimAge | Blood | Predicts mortality | Karma load |
| PhenoAge | Blood | Healthspan | Function |

**Pattern:** Methylation = Biological age = Samskara load

## 6.2 Reprogramming Evidence

| Study | Finding | Interpretation |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| Yamanaka (2006) | Cells reprogrammed to pluripotent | Samskaras cleared |
| Partial reprogramming | Rejuvenation without dedifferentiation | Selective clearing |
| In vivo studies | Old mice rejuvenated | Age reversal possible |

**Pattern:** Clear Samskaras = Rejuvenate

## 6.3 Longevity Intervention Evidence

| Intervention | Effect on Lifespan | Mechanism |
|--------------|-------------------|-----------|
| Caloric restriction | +30-50% (mice) | Slows accumulation |
| Rapamycin | +25% (mice) | mTOR/metabolism |
| Exercise | Slows clock | Multiple pathways |
| Meditation | Slows clock | Stress reduction |

## 6.4 Summary

| Finding | Samskara Model Fit |
|---------|-------------------|
| Epigenetic clocks work | ✓ Samskaras countable |
| Reprogramming works | ✓ Samskaras clearable |
| Lifestyle affects rate | ✓ Accumulation modifiable |
| Metabolic rate matters | ✓ Tick budget real |
