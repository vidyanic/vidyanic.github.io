|   AGING = SAMSKARA ACCUMULATION                              |
|                                                               |
|   Epigenetic marks accumulate over time                      |
|   Tamas gradually dominates Sattva                           |
|   Repair capacity declines                                   |
|   Eventually, body can't maintain order                      |
|                                                               |
|   BUT:                                                       |
|                                                               |
|   • Accumulation can be slowed (lifestyle)                   |
|   • Samskaras can be cleared (reprogramming)                 |
|   • Ticks can be conserved (Pranayama)                       |
|   • Atman never ages (only body does)                        |
|                                                               |
