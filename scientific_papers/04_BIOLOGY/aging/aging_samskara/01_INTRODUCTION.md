## 1.1 The Mystery of Aging

### 1.1.1 Why Do We Age?

Every multicellular organism ages. But why?

- Not a single cause
- Multiple interacting processes
- Seems programmed yet also damage-based

### 1.1.2 Current Theories

| Theory | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| **Wear and tear** | Accumulated damage |
| **Programmed** | Genetic clock |
| **Free radicals** | Oxidative damage |
| **Telomere** | Division counter |
| **Epigenetic** | Methylation drift |

## 1.2 The Epigenetic Clock

### 1.2.1 Horvath Clock (2013)

Steve Horvath discovered DNA methylation at specific sites correlates with age — the "epigenetic clock."

```
METHYLATION AT SPECIFIC SITES → BIOLOGICAL AGE

• Works across tissues
• Works across species
• More accurate than chronological age for health
```

### 1.2.2 Interpretation

The clock is measuring **accumulated epigenetic changes** — essentially, cellular Samskaras.

## 1.3 The Backend Model

### 1.3.1 Swasa (Breath) as Tick

```
BREATH BUDGET:
═════════════

Traditional estimate: ~778 million breaths/lifetime

Tortoise: 4/min → 150 years
Human: 15/min → 80 years
Mouse: 150/min → 2 years

Each breath = 1 tick
When ticks exhausted = Death
```

### 1.3.2 Tamas Accumulation

Life is Sattva (order) concentrated against Tamas (entropy).

Aging = Tamas gradually winning.

## 1.4 Paper Structure

This paper explores aging as Samskara accumulation and Tamas dominance.
