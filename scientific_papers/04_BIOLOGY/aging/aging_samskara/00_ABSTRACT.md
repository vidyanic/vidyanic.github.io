## Research Question

Is aging best understood as the accumulation of Samskaras (cellular impressions) and the dominance of Tamas (entropy) over Sattva (order)?

---

## Background

Aging is characterized by:
- Epigenetic drift (methylation changes)
- Telomere shortening
- Cellular damage accumulation
- Loss of regenerative capacity

In Backend terms:
- Samskara accumulation
- Tamas increasing
- Sattva decreasing
- Prana weakening

---

## Hypothesis

**H₁:** Aging is the progressive accumulation of cellular Samskaras (epigenetic marks) and the shift from Sattva-dominance to Tamas-dominance at the cellular level.

## Key Findings

| Aging Feature | Backend Parallel |
|---------------|------------------|
| Epigenetic drift | Samskara accumulation |
| Methylation clock | Karma counting |
| Loss of function | Tamas dominance |
| Cell senescence | Exhausted Prana |
| Death | Complete Tamas |

---

## Backend Correlation

| Scientific Term | Backend Term |
|-----------------|--------------|
| Biological age | Samskara load |
| Epigenetic clock | Karma counter |
| Rejuvenation | Rasayana (rejuvenation) |
| Reprogramming | Samskara clearing |
| Death | Prana exit, Kosha dissolution |

## Confidence Score

**81%**
