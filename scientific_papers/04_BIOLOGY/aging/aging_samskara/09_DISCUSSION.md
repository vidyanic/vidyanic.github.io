## 9.1 Summary

Aging is best understood as:
- Accumulation of epigenetic Samskaras
- Progressive Tamas dominance
- Exhaustion of allocated ticks

---

## 9.2 Implications

### 9.2.1 For Longevity

- Slow accumulation (lifestyle)
- Clear periodically (rejuvenation practices)
- Conserve ticks (breath work)

### 9.2.2 For Medicine

- Epigenetic interventions may reverse aging
- Partial reprogramming shows promise
- Lifestyle matters more than genetics

### 9.2.3 For You

- Your breath rate affects lifespan
- Meditation may literally slow aging
- Death is vehicle exhaustion, not self-end

---

## 9.3 Limitations

- Model is framework, not complete mechanism
- Many aging factors beyond epigenetics
- Individual variation significant
