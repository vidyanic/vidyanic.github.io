# 2. Literature Review

---

## 2.1 Epigenetic Aging

### 2.1.1 Horvath (2013)

DNA methylation clock predicts biological age across tissues.

### 2.1.2 Hannum (2013)

Blood-based methylation clock.

### 2.1.3 Subsequent Clocks

- GrimAge (mortality predictor)
- PhenoAge (healthspan predictor)
- DunedinPACE (pace of aging)

## 2.2 Reprogramming

### 2.2.1 Yamanaka Factors (2006)

Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, Myc (OSKM) can reprogram adult cells to pluripotent state — resetting the clock.

### 2.2.2 Partial Reprogramming

Brief OSKM exposure rejuvenates without full dedifferentiation — cells become younger but maintain identity.

## 2.3 Longevity Interventions

| Intervention | Effect | Mechanism |
|--------------|--------|-----------|
| Caloric restriction | Extends lifespan | Slows clock |
| Rapamycin | Extends lifespan | mTOR inhibition |
| Metformin | May extend | Metabolic |
| Exercise | Slows aging | Multiple |

## 2.4 Backend on Longevity

### 2.4.1 Rasayana (Rejuvenation)

Ayurveda describes Rasayana — practices and substances that rejuvenate and extend life.

### 2.4.2 Pranayama

Breath control (Pranayama) = Tick conservation. Fewer breaths/minute = Longer life.
