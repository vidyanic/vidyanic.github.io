# 4. Hypothesis

## 4.1 Central Hypothesis

**H₁:** Aging is the progressive accumulation of epigenetic Samskaras and the gradual dominance of Tamas over Sattva at the cellular level.

## 4.2 Predictions

| Prediction | Test | Status |
|------------|------|--------|
| Age = Epigenetic accumulation | Methylation clocks | ✓ |
| Reversal possible | Reprogramming | ✓ |
| Slower metabolism = Longer life | CR, metabolic studies | ✓ |
| Practice affects aging | Meditation studies | ✓ |

## 4.3 Falsifiability

Would be falsified if:
- Epigenetic clocks didn't correlate with aging
- Reprogramming didn't rejuvenate
- Metabolic rate unrelated to lifespan

All falsification attempts have failed — hypothesis supported.
