## 8.1 The Breath Budget

```
SWASA-SANKHYA (श्वास-सङ्ख्या):
===============================

PRINCIPLE:
Each life has finite breath allocation

CALCULATION:
~778 million breaths average

VARIATION:
Tortoise: 4/min -> ~150 years
Human: 15/min -> ~80 years  
Mouse: 150/min -> ~2 years

CONSERVATION:
Pranayama = Slow breathing = More time
Samadhi = Minimal breathing = Tick pause
```

## 8.2 Rasayana (Rejuvenation)

### 8.2.1 Traditional Approach

Backend Architecture describes Rasayana (रसायन) — rejuvenation practices:

| Practice | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| Herbal Rasayana | Tissue nourishment |
| Behavioral Rasayana | Lifestyle optimization |
| Pranayama | Breath conservation |
| Meditation | Stress reduction |

### 8.2.2 Modern Parallel

| Backend | Modern Equivalent |
|---------|-------------------|
| Rasayana | Anti-aging interventions |
| Pranayama | Metabolic slowing |
| Samskara Shuddhi | Epigenetic reprogramming |
| Kaya Kalpa | Radical rejuvenation |

## 8.3 Death as Tamas Completion

```
DEATH PROCESS:
==============

LIFE STATE:
Sattva > Tamas
Repair > Damage
Order maintained

AGING:
Sattva v, Tamas ^
Repair slowing
Order declining

DEATH:
Tamas complete
No more repair
Body -> 5 elements
```

---

## 8.4 Moksha as Escape

```
THE GOAL:
=========

Aging -> Death -> Rebirth (cycle continues)

UNLESS:
Moksha (liberation) = Escape from cycle

HOW:
Realize Atman ≠ Body
Body ages, Atman doesn't
Death = Leaving vehicle
Not end of consciousness
```
