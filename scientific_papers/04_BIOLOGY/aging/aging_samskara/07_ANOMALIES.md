## 7.1 Naked Mole Rats

### 7.1.1 The Phenomenon

Naked mole rats live 30+ years (10x expected for size) and show negligible senescence.

### 7.1.2 Interpretation

Highly efficient repair systems — maintaining Sattva against Tamas. Exceptional "Samskara clearing" capacity.

## 7.2 Turritopsis dohrnii (Immortal Jellyfish)

### 7.2.1 The Phenomenon

This jellyfish can revert from adult to juvenile — essentially resetting its age.

### 7.2.2 Interpretation

Natural reprogramming — clearing all Samskaras and starting fresh. Proof that biology can reverse aging.

## 7.3 Centenarians

### 7.3.1 The Phenomenon

Some humans live 100+ years in good health.

### 7.3.2 Interpretation

Likely combination of:
- Genetic factors (efficient repair)
- Lifestyle (slow accumulation)
- Possibly: Spiritual practice (Samskara management)

## 7.4 Progeria

### 7.4.1 The Phenomenon

Children age rapidly (Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria).
