## APPENDIX C: DHARMA RESTORATION PROTOCOL

### C.1 Comprehensive Protocol

```
PHASE 1: ASSESSMENT (Weeks 1-2)
===============================
• Identify specific triggers (food, infection, stress)
• Assess gut permeability (zonulin, lactulose-mannitol)
• Measure autoimmune markers (antibodies, CRP)
• Evaluate lifestyle factors

PHASE 2: ELIMINATION (Weeks 3-8)
================================
• Remove identified triggers
• Start AIP or elimination diet
• Reduce toxin exposure
• Address chronic infections

PHASE 3: HEALING (Weeks 9-16)
=============================
• Gut healing protocol (L-glutamine, zinc carnosine)
• Anti-inflammatory support (omega-3, curcumin)
• Stress management (meditation, yoga)
• Sleep optimization

PHASE 4: RESTORATION (Weeks 17-24+)
===================================
• Gradual food reintroduction
• Continued stress management
• Cellular support (targeted nutrients)
• Monitor markers for improvement

PHASE 5: MAINTENANCE (Ongoing)
==============================
• Personalized diet based on tolerance
• Continued lifestyle practices
• Regular monitoring
• Early intervention if needed
```

### C.2 Key Supplements
