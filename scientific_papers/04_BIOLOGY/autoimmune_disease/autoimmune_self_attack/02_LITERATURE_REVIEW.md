# 02. LITERATURE REVIEW — Self-Recognition and Immunity

---

## 2.1 IMMUNOLOGY FUNDAMENTALS

### Self-Recognition System

The immune system uses multiple mechanisms to distinguish self from non-self:

**1. Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC)**
- MHC Class I on all nucleated cells
- Unique to each individual (like fingerprint)
- Displays cellular "contents" for inspection
- T-cells constantly check these markers

**2. Central Tolerance**
- T-cells "trained" in thymus
- Those that attack self are eliminated
- Creates immune repertoire that ignores self

**3. Peripheral Tolerance**
- Additional checkpoints in body
- Regulatory T-cells suppress auto-reactive cells
- Multiple layers of protection

### When Tolerance Fails

| Mechanism | Description | Disease Examples |
|-----------|-------------|------------------|
| Molecular mimicry | Pathogen resembles self | Rheumatic fever, MS |
| Bystander activation | Inflammation exposes hidden self | Type 1 diabetes |
| Epitope spreading | Attack expands to new targets | Lupus, RA |
| Loss of regulation | Treg cells fail | Multiple conditions |

## 2.2 MOLECULAR MIMICRY RESEARCH

### Key Studies

**1. Streptococcus and Heart (Rheumatic Fever)**
- Streptococcal proteins resemble heart tissue
- Antibodies against bacteria attack heart
- Classic molecular mimicry case

**2. EBV and Multiple Sclerosis**
- Epstein-Barr virus linked to MS
- Viral proteins resemble myelin
- Cross-reactive antibodies damage nerves

**3. Gut Bacteria and Arthritis**
- Certain gut bacteria resemble joint proteins
- Antibodies cross-react with joints
- Links gut health to joint health

### The Limitation

Molecular mimicry explains HOW confusion occurs
but not WHY it happens in some individuals and not others.

## 2.3 GUT-IMMUNE CONNECTION

### Leaky Gut Research

**Fasano, A. et al. (2005-2020)**
- Discovered zonulin (regulates gut permeability)
- Demonstrated "leaky gut" in autoimmunity
- Connected intestinal barrier to immune function

**Key Findings:**
- Increased permeability precedes autoimmunity
- Food proteins enter bloodstream
- Immune system attacks these proteins
- Cross-reactivity with body tissues

### The Gut-Immune Axis

```
GUT PERMEABILITY CASCADE:
=========================

Healthy gut barrier -> Intact
           v
Stress/Toxins/Diet -> Barrier weakens
           v
Undigested proteins -> Enter bloodstream
           v
Immune response -> Attacks proteins
           v
Cross-reactivity -> Attacks similar body tissues
           v
Autoimmune disease -> Develops
```

## 2.4 EPIGENETIC FACTORS

### Environmental Gene Expression

**Studies show:**
- Identical twins don't always share autoimmunity
- Environmental factors modify gene expression
- Stress, toxins, infections leave epigenetic marks
- These marks can alter MHC expression

### Transgenerational Effects

- Some autoimmune tendencies pass through generations
- Beyond simple genetics — epigenetic inheritance
- Matches Samskara theory of inherited impressions

## 2.5 MIND-BODY RESEARCH

### Psychoneuroimmunology

**Documented connections:**
- Stress increases autoimmune flares
- Depression correlates with autoimmunity
- Meditation reduces inflammatory markers
- Emotional trauma precedes onset in many cases

### Personality Patterns

Research suggests common patterns in autoimmunity:
- Difficulty setting boundaries
- Self-sacrifice patterns
- Suppressed emotions
- Perfectionism

## 2.6 BACKEND SOURCES

### Ayurvedic Understanding

**Charaka Samhita** describes:
- Ama (toxins) from weak Agni (digestion)
- Ama confuses tissue recognition
- Treatment: Strengthen Agni, clear Ama

**Ashtanga Hridaya** on immunity:
- Ojas (vital essence) protects body
- Low Ojas = vulnerability
- Build Ojas through lifestyle

### Vedic Framework

**Bhagavad Gita 3.35:**
- Svadharma (own duty) is safest
- Para-dharma (another's duty) is dangerous
- Applies at cellular level — cells must perform their own Dharma

## 2.7 GAP IN LITERATURE

No existing research:
1. Frames autoimmunity as identity confusion (vs dysfunction)
2. Compares systematically to cancer (opposite error)
3. Proposes identity restoration (vs suppression)
4. Provides unified framework across all conditions

**This paper fills these gaps.**
