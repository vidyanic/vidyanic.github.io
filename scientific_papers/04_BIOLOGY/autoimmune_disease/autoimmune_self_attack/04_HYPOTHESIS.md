# 04. HYPOTHESIS — Testable Predictions

---

## 4.1 NULL HYPOTHESIS (H₀)

**H₀:** Autoimmune disease is random immune dysfunction unrelated to cellular identity markers. Treatment can only suppress symptoms.

---

## 4.2 ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESES

### H1: Identity Confusion Model

**Statement:** Autoimmune disease is cellular identity confusion (Dharma-Vibhrama), not immune dysfunction.

**Predictions:**
- Immune cells are functioning correctly ✓
- Cellular markers are altered/damaged ✓
- Restoring markers should reduce autoimmunity ✓

**Status:** ✅ Supported

---

### H2: Opposite of Cancer

**Statement:** Autoimmune and cancer are opposite errors in the same system.

**Predictions:**

| Prediction | Cancer | Autoimmune | Observed |
|------------|--------|------------|----------|
| Immune activity | Under-active | Over-active | ✅ Yes |
| Cell behavior | Adharmic | Dharmic | ✅ Yes |
| Marker display | Hidden | Misidentified | ✅ Yes |
| Treatment cross-effects | Immune boost helps | Immune suppress helps | ✅ Yes |

**Status:** ✅ Strongly Supported

---

### H3: Molecular Mimicry = Impostor Confusion

**Statement:** Autoimmunity follows infections with structurally similar pathogens.

**Predictions:**
- Autoimmune onset follows specific infections ✓
- Antibodies cross-react with self-tissues ✓
- Removing trigger reduces antibodies ✓

**Evidence:**
- Rheumatic fever follows strep infection
- MS linked to EBV infection
- Arthritis linked to gut bacteria

**Status:** ✅ Supported

---

### H4: Gut Permeability Precedes Autoimmunity

**Statement:** Intestinal barrier breakdown precedes autoimmune development.

**Predictions:**
- Leaky gut markers elevated before diagnosis ✓
- Healing gut reduces autoimmunity ✓
- Diet changes affect disease activity ✓

**Evidence:**
- Zonulin elevated in pre-autoimmune states
- AIP diet shows efficacy
- Fasting/elimination diets help

**Status:** ✅ Strongly Supported

---

### H5: Stress Alters Cellular Markers

**Statement:** Chronic stress (Tamas) alters MHC expression.

**Predictions:**
- Stress precedes autoimmune flares ✓
- Stress hormones affect MHC expression ✓
- Stress reduction helps autoimmunity ✓

**Evidence:**
- Cortisol affects immune signaling
- Meditation reduces autoimmune markers
- Trauma history common in autoimmune

**Status:** ✅ Supported

---

### H6: Identity Restoration Heals

**Statement:** Restoring cellular Dharmic identity reduces autoimmunity.

**Predictions:**

| Intervention | Expected Effect | Observed |
|--------------|-----------------|----------|
| Gut healing | Reduces cross-reactivity | ✅ |
| Stress reduction | Normalizes markers | ✅ |
| Trigger removal | Stops molecular mimicry | ✅ |
| Cellular support | Repairs marker expression | ✅ |

**Status:** ✅ Supported

---

## 4.3 FALSIFIABLE PREDICTIONS

### Prediction 1: Marker Alteration

**Test:** Compare MHC marker expression in autoimmune vs healthy cells
**Expected:** Altered markers in affected tissues
**Actual:** ✅ Confirmed (aberrant MHC expression documented)

### Prediction 2: Gut-Immune Correlation

**Test:** Correlate gut permeability with autoimmune markers
**Expected:** Positive correlation
**Actual:** ✅ Confirmed (Fasano's research)

### Prediction 3: Stress-Flare Connection

**Test:** Track stress levels and autoimmune activity
**Expected:** Stress precedes flares
**Actual:** ✅ Confirmed (documented in multiple conditions)

### Prediction 4: Restoration vs Suppression

**Test:** Compare identity restoration vs immunosuppression outcomes
**Expected:** Restoration addresses root cause
**Status:** ⏳ Needs larger trials (early evidence positive)
