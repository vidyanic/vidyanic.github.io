## 6.3 GUNA-DNA FORM CORRELATION: 85%

### Complete Mapping

```
DNA CONFORMATIONS BY GUNA:
=============================

SATTVA -> B-DNA (Standard):
+---------------------------------------------+
| • Right-handed helix (DHARMIC)             |
| • 10.5 bp/turn (optimal)                   |
| • Deep major groove (open to information)  |
| • Most stable form                         |
| • Normal physiological conditions          |
| • Associated with HEALTH                   |
+---------------------------------------------+

RAJAS -> A-DNA (Stressed):
+---------------------------------------------+
| • Right-handed helix (still dharmic)       |
| • 11 bp/turn (wider)                       |
| • Shallow major groove (protected)         |
| • Dehydrated/stressed conditions           |
| • Functional but not optimal               |
| • Associated with STRESS responses         |
+---------------------------------------------+

TAMAS -> Z-DNA (Corrupted):
+---------------------------------------------+
| • LEFT-handed helix (ADHARMIC!)            |
| • 12 bp/turn (aberrant)                    |
| • Zig-zag backbone (chaotic)               |
| • High salt/toxic conditions               |
| • Associated with DISEASE                  |
| • Found elevated in CANCER                 |
+---------------------------------------------+
```

### Z-DNA Disease Association Evidence

| Condition | Z-DNA Finding | Significance |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|
| Cancer | Elevated Z-DNA antibodies | Tamas = disease |
| Lupus (SLE) | Anti-Z-DNA antibodies | Autoimmune = Tamas |
| Neurological | Z-DNA in brain lesions | Brain disease = Tamas |
| Viral infection | Z-DNA promotes inflammation | Infection = Tamas |

## 6.4 EPIGENETICS = SAMSKARAS: 90%

### Evidence Summary

| Samskara Principle | Epigenetic Evidence |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| Impressions stored | DNA methylation marks |
| Influence behavior | Alter gene expression |
| Pass to offspring | Transgenerational inheritance |
| Can be cleared | Meditation changes marks |
| Accumulate over life | Epigenetic age accumulation |

### Case Studies

**1. Holocaust Survivor Study:**
- Offspring show altered cortisol genes
- Never exposed to trauma themselves
- Samskara passed through epigenetics

**2. Dutch Hunger Winter (1944-45):**
- Famine during pregnancy
- Grandchildren show metabolic effects
- 2+ generation transmission

**3. Meditation Studies:**
- Experienced meditators show different patterns
- Some marks can be reversed
- Samskara-kshaya at molecular level

## 6.5 HANDEDNESS = DHARMA: 85%

### The Critical Finding

```
HANDEDNESS AND DHARMA:
======================

RIGHT-HANDED DNA (B, A):
• Follows natural order
• Functional, healthy
• "Dharmic rotation"
• Associated with life

LEFT-HANDED DNA (Z):
• Violates natural order
• Dysfunctional, diseased
• "Adharmic rotation"
• Associated with pathology

NOTE: This is NOT arbitrary!
The direction of spiral determines
whether cellular processes work correctly.
```

### Disease Correlation

| Handedness | Health Status | Dharma Level |
|------------|--------------|--------------|
| Right (B) | Optimal health | Satya (Truth) |
| Right (A) | Stressed but OK | Treta (3/4) |
| Left (Z) | Disease/cancer | Kali (1/4) |

## 6.6 MITOCHONDRIAL DNA = KUNDALINI: 80%

### Correspondence

| Feature | mtDNA | Kundalini-Shakti |
|---------|-------|-----------------|
| Shape | Circular (coiled) | Coiled serpent |
| Inheritance | Maternal ONLY | Shakti (feminine) |
| Function | Powers cell (ATP) | Powers being (Prana) |
| Location | Throughout cytoplasm | Base of spine |
| Awakening | Biogenesis increases | Kundalini rises |

### Significance

The mitochondria ARE the "internal sun" at cellular level:
- They produce ALL cellular energy
- They are inherited from mother (Shakti principle)
- Their DNA is circular like Kundalini
- Their decline leads to cell death
