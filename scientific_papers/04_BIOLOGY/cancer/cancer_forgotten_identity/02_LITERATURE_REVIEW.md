# 2. Literature Review

---

## 2.1 Dedifferentiation Research

### 2.1.1 Warburg (1924)

Otto Warburg discovered cancer cells prefer glycolysis even with oxygen — a primitive, embryonic metabolic state.

### 2.1.2 Weinberg (2011)

Hallmarks of Cancer paper: All hallmarks can be seen as loss of differentiated identity.

---

## 2.2 Cancer Stem Cells

### 2.2.1 The CSC Hypothesis

Some cancer cells have stem-cell-like properties:
- Self-renewal
- Differentiation potential
- Tumor-initiating capacity

**Interpretation:** Cancer contains cells that have reverted to primitive state.

## 2.3 Differentiation Therapy

### 2.3.1 APL and Retinoic Acid

Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia treated by FORCING differentiation with retinoic acid — "reminding" cells of identity.

---

## 2.4 Epigenetic Dysregulation

Cancer cells show disrupted methylation — their "identity marks" are scrambled.
