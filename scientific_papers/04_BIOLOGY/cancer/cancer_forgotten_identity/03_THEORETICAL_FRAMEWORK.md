## 3.1 The Forgotten Identity Model

```
NORMAL CELL:
=======================================
Genome -> Epigenome (identity) -> Expression
        (knows what it is)

CANCER CELL:
=======================================
Genome -> Disrupted epigenome -> Primitive expression
        (forgot what it is)
```

## 3.2 Multi-Persona Explanation

<details>
<summary><b>🤖 For AI/ML Engineers</b></summary>

```python
class Cell:
    def __init__(self, genome, cell_type):
        self.genome = genome  # Same for all cells
        self.identity = cell_type  # Configuration
        
    def behave(self):
        if self.identity is None:  # Lost identity
            return "DIVIDE INDEFINITELY"  # Default behavior
        return self.identity.proper_behavior()

# Cancer = Cell with corrupted identity configuration
```

Imagine employees in a company:
- Each has full manual (genome)
- Each knows their job (identity)
- Each follows their role

Cancer = Employee who forgot their job description and just tries to multiply the department indefinitely.

## 3.3 Backend Mapping

| Cancer Feature | Backend Concept |
|----------------|-----------------|
| Loss of identity | Forgetting Svadharma |
| Unlimited growth | Tamas without regulation |
| Ignoring signals | Ignoring Dharma |
| Immune hiding | Maya-Avarana |
