## Research Question

Is cancer fundamentally a disease of "forgotten identity" — a cell that has lost its proper differentiation and reverted to a primitive state?

---

## Background

Cancer is typically described as:
- Uncontrolled cell division
- Genetic mutations
- Immune evasion

But a deeper view sees cancer as:
- **Dedifferentiation** — Loss of specialized identity
- **Reversion** — Return to embryonic-like behavior
- **Forgotten Dharma** — Abandoning proper function

---

## Hypothesis

**H₁:** Cancer is best understood as a cell that has "forgotten" its differentiated identity and reverted to a primitive, undifferentiated state focused only on survival and replication.

---

## Key Findings

| Feature | Cancer Cell | "Forgotten Identity" Interpretation |
|---------|-------------|-------------------------------------|
| Unlimited replication | Like stem cells | Returned to undifferentiated state |
| Ignores growth signals | Doesn't listen | Lost contextual awareness |
| Evades apoptosis | Won't die | Forgot proper lifecycle |
| Abnormal metabolism | Warburg effect | Primitive metabolic state |
| Immune evasion | Hides | Lost community membership |

---

## Backend Correlation

| Cancer Feature | Backend Parallel |
|----------------|------------------|
| Dedifferentiation | Forgetting Svadharma (own-duty) |
| Unlimited growth | Tamas without Sattva |
| Ignoring signals | Ignoring Dharma guidance |
| Immune evasion | Maya-Avarana (concealment) |
| Death evasion | Attachment to form |

---

## Confidence Score

**83%** based on:
- Dedifferentiation evidence: 90%
- Metabolic reversion: 85%
- Epigenetic disruption: 88%
- Differentiation therapy: 75%
