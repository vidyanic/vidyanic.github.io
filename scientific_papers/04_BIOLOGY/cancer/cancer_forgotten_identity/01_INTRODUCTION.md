## 1.1 What Is Cancer?

### 1.1.1 The Standard View

Cancer is typically defined by **hallmarks**:
1. Self-sufficiency in growth signals
2. Insensitivity to anti-growth signals
3. Evading apoptosis
4. Limitless replicative potential
5. Sustained angiogenesis
6. Tissue invasion and metastasis
7. Deregulated metabolism
8. Immune evasion

### 1.1.2 The Deeper View

All these hallmarks share one theme:

> **The cell has forgotten what it's supposed to be.**

A normal cell "knows" it's a liver cell, skin cell, neuron. It follows the rules of its tissue. Cancer cells **lose this identity**.

## 1.2 The Identity Problem

### 1.2.1 Differentiation

```
EMBRYONIC STEM CELL:
• Can become anything
• Unlimited division
• No specialized function
• "Universal potential"

DIFFERENTIATED CELL:
• Is one thing (liver, skin, etc.)
• Limited division
• Specialized function
• "Realized potential"
```

### 1.2.2 Cancer as Dedifferentiation

```
CANCER CELL:
• Acts like it can become anything
• Unlimited division
• Lost specialized function
• "Forgotten identity"

CANCER = DIFFERENTIATED CELL THAT FORGOT
```

## 1.3 The Backend Parallel

### 1.3.1 Svadharma (Own-Duty)

In Backend Architecture, every being has a **Svadharma** (स्वधर्म) — their own proper function within the larger system.

| Entity | Svadharma |
|--------|-----------|
| Liver cell | Metabolize, detoxify |
| Neuron | Transmit signals |
| Skin cell | Protect, barrier |
| Stem cell | Become differentiated |

### 1.3.2 Cancer as Forgotten Svadharma

When a cell "forgets" its Svadharma:
- Acts only from survival instinct (Tamas)
- Ignores contextual signals (Dharma)
- Disrupts the larger system (body)
