## 6.1 Dedifferentiation Evidence

| Cancer Type | Differentiation | Prognosis |
|-------------|-----------------|-----------|
| Well-differentiated | High | Better |
| Moderately differentiated | Medium | Intermediate |
| Poorly differentiated | Low | Worse |
| Anaplastic | Almost none | Worst |

**Pattern:** Less identity = More aggressive

## 6.2 Metabolic Reversion

| Feature | Normal Cell | Cancer Cell | Embryonic Cell |
|---------|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| Main ATP source | Oxidative phosphorylation | Glycolysis | Glycolysis |
| Oxygen requirement | High | Low | Low |

**Cancer = Embryonic metabolism**

## 6.3 Epigenetic Disruption

| Finding | Interpretation |
|---------|----------------|
| Global hypomethylation | Identity marks lost |
| Local hypermethylation | Tumor suppressors silenced |
| Histone modifications altered | Chromatin structure changed |

## 6.4 Differentiation Therapy

| Cancer | Treatment | Result |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| APL | Retinoic acid | Remission |
| Neuroblastoma | Retinoic acid | Some success |
| Various | Experimental | Ongoing |

**When you remind cells of identity, some respond.**
