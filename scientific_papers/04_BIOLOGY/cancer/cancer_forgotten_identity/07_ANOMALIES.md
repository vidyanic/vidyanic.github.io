### 7.1.1 The Phenomenon

Rare cases where cancer disappears without treatment.

## 7.2 Teratomas

### 7.2.1 The Phenomenon

Tumors containing multiple tissue types (hair, teeth, etc.)

### 7.2.2 Interpretation

## 7.3 Cancer and Consciousness

### 7.3.1 Observations

Some studies suggest psychological factors influence cancer:
- Stress → Worse outcomes
- Social support → Better outcomes
- Purpose/meaning → Better outcomes

### 7.3.2 Backend Interpretation

Consciousness (Atman) influences cellular identity. When Atman is engaged (purpose, meaning), cells may better "remember" their Dharma.
