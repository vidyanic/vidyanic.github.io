# 9. Discussion

## 9.1 Summary

Cancer is best understood as **forgotten identity** — a cell that has lost its differentiation and reverted to primitive behavior.

---

## 9.2 Implications

### 9.2.1 For Treatment

- Focus on **restoring identity**, not just killing cells
- Differentiation therapy may be underutilized
- Support Sattva (order) in lifestyle

### 9.2.2 For Prevention

- Maintain cellular identity through:
  - Reducing Tamas (toxins, stress)
  - Supporting Sattva (order, meaning)
  - Epigenetic maintenance

### 9.2.3 For Understanding

Cancer isn't random mutation — it's a coherent syndrome of forgotten identity. This reframing may enable new approaches.

---

## 9.3 Limitations

- Not all cancers fit perfectly
- Genetic drivers are real
- Model is conceptual framework, not complete mechanism
