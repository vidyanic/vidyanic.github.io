## 8.1 Svadharma (Own-Duty)

```
SVADHARMA (स्वधर्म):
===================

Every entity has its proper function:
• Liver cell -> Metabolize
• Neuron -> Transmit
• Cancer cell -> FORGOT

"Better one's own Dharma poorly done
 than another's Dharma well done."
— Bhagavad Gita 3.35
```

Normal cell: **Sattva** (order) balances **Tamas** (inertia/growth)

Cancer cell: **Tamas** dominates — growth without wisdom

| Guna | Normal | Cancer |
|------|--------|--------|
| Sattva | Maintains identity | Lost |
| Rajas | Appropriate activity | Hyperactive |
| Tamas | Appropriate rest | Dominant growth |

| Suppress T cells | Dampen perception |
| Create microenvironment | Build concealing fog |
