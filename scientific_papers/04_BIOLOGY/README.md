## 💡 The Key Insight

**Biology studies the vehicle (body).**
**Vedas study the driver (consciousness) AND the vehicle.**

```
BIOLOGY (Mechanism)    ↔     VEDAS (Purpose)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━        ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
DNA codes proteins     <-     Samskaras express
Species evolve         <-     Jiva progresses
Cells age              <-     Prana depletes
Cancer spreads         <-     Identity forgotten
```

**ॐ जीवो ब्रह्मैव नापरः**  
*The Jiva is Brahman itself, not other*
