# Abstract: Transpersonal Psychology = Adhyatma Vidya

## Core Thesis

Transpersonal psychology — the study of states and experiences transcending the ego — is the Western rediscovery of Adhyatma Vidya (आध्यात्म विद्या), the Vedic science of spiritual self-knowledge. This paper demonstrates that transpersonal phenomena correspond precisely to states documented in Vedic literature for millennia.

## Background

**Western Context:**
Transpersonal psychology emerged in the late 1960s as the "Fourth Force" in psychology:
1. Psychoanalysis (Freud) — Unconscious dynamics
2. Behaviorism (Skinner) — Observable behavior
3. Humanistic (Maslow, Rogers) — Self-actualization
4. **Transpersonal** — Beyond the personal self

Key contributions:
- **Maslow:** Peak experiences, self-transcendence as highest need
- **Grof:** Holotropic breathwork, perinatal matrices, cartography of the psyche
- **Wilber:** Integral psychology, spectrum of consciousness
- **Assagioli:** Psychosynthesis, higher self

**Vedic Context:**
Adhyatma Vidya (self-knowledge) has mapped consciousness for millennia:
- **Mandukya Upanishad:** Four states (waking, dreaming, deep sleep, Turiya)
- **Yoga Sutras:** Eight limbs, Samadhi states
- **Tantric texts:** Chakras, kundalini, consciousness levels
- **Vedanta:** Atman-Brahman identity

## Hypothesis

**H1:** Transpersonal experiences documented in Western psychology correspond to states described in Vedic Adhyatma literature.

**H2:** These experiences represent higher developmental stages, not pathology.

**H3:** The Vedic framework provides a more complete map of transpersonal territory than current Western models.

## Methodology

1. **State Mapping:** Compare Western transpersonal categories with Vedic states
2. **Experience Analysis:** Match phenomenological reports
3. **Developmental Correlation:** Align stage models
4. **Practical Integration:** Compare methodologies
5. **Validation:** Apply 7-concept stack
