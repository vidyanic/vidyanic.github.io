|  THE VEDIC CLAIM:                                                   |
|  "अहं ब्रह्मास्मि" - I am Brahman                                     |
|  You are not limited to the ego. You are the cosmic Self.           |
|  This can be realized. The path is documented.                      |
|                                                                     |
|  THE TRANSPERSONAL DISCOVERY:                                       |
|  Peak experiences reveal states beyond ego.                         |
|  These are real, valid, developmental.                              |
|  They represent human potential beyond self-actualization.          |
|                                                                     |
|  THE SYNTHESIS:                                                     |
|  Transpersonal psychology = Vedic psychology in modern terms.       |
|  What Maslow glimpsed, the rishis mapped.                           |
|  What Grof explored, the yogis systematized.                        |
|  The fourth force of psychology rediscovers the first.              |
|                                                                     |
