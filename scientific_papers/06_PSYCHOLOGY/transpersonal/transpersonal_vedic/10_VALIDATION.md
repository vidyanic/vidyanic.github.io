## 10.2 Concept 1: Conservation

### Test
Is consciousness/information preserved across transpersonal states?

### Analysis
- Consciousness doesn't disappear in transcendence
- Content transforms but awareness continues
- Identity information preserved even when ego dissolves
- "Experiencer" exists in all states

### Validation

```
CONSERVATION CHECK:
-------------------
Consciousness persists across states          [PASS]
Information transforms, doesn't disappear     [PASS]
Awareness is constant (Turiya witness)        [PASS]

STATUS: VALIDATED
```

---

## 10.3 Concept 2: Entropy

### Test
How do transpersonal states relate to entropy?

### Analysis
- Higher states = More organized consciousness (lower entropy)
- Ego dissolution = Releasing rigid structures
- Integration = New order at higher level
- Spiritual development decreases psychological entropy

### Validation

```
ENTROPY CHECK:
--------------
Higher states are more organized              [PASS]
Development decreases inner chaos             [PASS]
Integration creates coherence                 [PASS]

STATUS: VALIDATED
```

---

## 10.4 Concept 3: Fractal

### Test
Are transpersonal patterns self-similar at different scales?

### Analysis
- Individual Atman = Universal Brahman (same at different scales)
- Microcosm-macrocosm principle
- States map from individual to cosmic
- "As above, so below"

### Validation

```
FRACTAL CHECK:
--------------
Atman = Brahman (micro = macro)               [PASS]
Same patterns individual and cosmic           [PASS]
Self-similarity across scales                 [PASS]

STATUS: VALIDATED
```

---

## 10.5 Concept 4: Karma

### Test
Do practices cause transpersonal effects?

### Analysis
- Meditation -> Samadhi (practice -> result)
- Accumulated practice -> Deeper states
- Actions determine trajectory
- Cause-effect in spiritual development

### Validation

```
KARMA CHECK:
------------
Practice leads to state                       [PASS]
Actions shape development                     [PASS]
Cause-effect relationship clear               [PASS]

STATUS: VALIDATED
```

---

## 10.6 Concept 5: Observer

### Test
Is the observer central to transpersonal psychology?

### Analysis
- The CORE of transpersonal = Shift in observer
- Who is observing? This is the key question
- States change based on observer's position
- Sakshi (witness) is the goal

### Validation

```
OBSERVER CHECK:
---------------
Observer is central to framework              [PASS]
State depends on observer position            [PASS]
Witness consciousness is goal                 [PASS]

STATUS: VALIDATED (This IS the core topic)
```

---

## 10.7 Concept 6: Cycles

### Test
Are there cycles in transpersonal development?

### Analysis
- States come and go (cyclic)
- Development has stages (cyclic patterns)
- Breath, attention, awareness cycle
- Samadhi -> Normal -> Samadhi (until stabilized)

### Validation

```
CYCLES CHECK:
-------------
States are cyclic initially                   [PASS]
Development has stage patterns                [PASS]
Practice involves rhythms                     [PASS]

STATUS: VALIDATED
```

---

## 10.8 Concept 7: Gunas

### Test
Can transpersonal states be classified by Gunas?

### Analysis

| State | Dominant Guna |
|-------|---------------|
| Dull trance | Tamas |
| Active ecstasy | Rajas |
| Clear witness | Sattva |
| Pure Turiya | Beyond Gunas |

### Validation

```
GUNAS CHECK:
------------
States classifiable by Gunas                  [PASS]
S/R/T dynamics present                        [PASS]
Sattva leads to transcendence                 [PASS]

STATUS: VALIDATED
```
