## 4.1 Null Hypothesis (H₀)

**There is no systematic correspondence between Western depth psychology and Vedic Chitta psychology.**

The similarities are:
- Coincidental
- Too general to be meaningful
- Not predictive
- Not therapeutically useful

---

## 4.2 Alternative Hypotheses

### H1: Structural Correspondence

**Freud's structural model (Id/Ego/Superego) corresponds to the Vedic Antahkarana (Chitta/Ahamkara/Buddhi) model.**

| Test Criterion | Expected if True |
|----------------|------------------|
| Function match | Each component serves equivalent function |
| Dynamic match | Interactions follow same patterns |
| Pathology match | Disorders map to Vedic imbalances |
| Treatment match | Therapeutic approaches converge |

### H2: Collective Unconscious = Hiranyagarbha

**Jung's collective unconscious is the individual's connection to Hiranyagarbha (cosmic mind).**

| Test Criterion | Expected if True |
|----------------|------------------|
| Universality explained | Archetypes universal because Hiranyagarbha universal |
| Inheritance mechanism | Chitta carries patterns, not just genes |
| Numinosity explained | Archetypes numinous because Devas are real |
| Synchronicity explained | Connections through cosmic mind |

### H3: Archetypes = Devas

**Jungian archetypes are psychologized versions of Vedic Devas (cosmic principles).**

| Test Criterion | Expected if True |
|----------------|------------------|
| One-to-one mapping | Each archetype has a Deva correspondent |
| Function equivalence | Same psychological function |
| Cross-cultural presence | Both appear in all cultures |
| Autonomous action | Both act independently of ego |

### H4: Vedic Model More Complete

**The Vedic psychology extends beyond Western depth psychology to include transcendent dimensions.**

| Test Criterion | Expected if True |
|----------------|------------------|
| Additional components | Vedic includes Atman, Brahman |
| Higher goal | Moksha beyond individuation |
| Complete cartography | All Western findings fit within Vedic |
| Practical extension | Yoga practices go further |

## 4.3 Predictions

### 4.3.1 If Hypotheses Are Correct

1. **Therapeutic convergence** — Vedic and Western methods should work on same mechanisms
2. **Cross-training benefit** — Therapists trained in both should be more effective
3. **Explanatory power** — Vedic model should explain what Western can't
4. **Meditation effectiveness** — Yoga practices should produce depth-psychological changes

### 4.3.2 Observable Outcomes

| Prediction | Observable Evidence |
|------------|---------------------|
| Samskaras ≈ complexes | Similar clinical presentation |
| Vasanas ≈ drives | Similar behavioral outcomes |
| Chitta stilling helps | Meditation reduces symptoms |
| Devas encountered | Archetypal experiences in practice |

## 4.4 Falsifiability

### 4.4.1 What Would Disprove H1

- Freudian model works where Antahkarana doesn't
- No functional correspondence between components
- Treatment based on one fails for other

### 4.4.2 What Would Disprove H2

- Collective unconscious fully explained by genetics
- No cross-cultural archetypal patterns
- Hiranyagarbha has no psychological parallel

### 4.4.3 What Would Disprove H3

- Archetypes don't map to Devas
- Different functions in each tradition
- Cultural specificity of archetypes

### 4.4.4 What Would Disprove H4

- Western model accounts for everything
- No evidence for transcendent dimension
- Vedic additions have no psychological reality

## 4.5 Scope of Claims

### 4.5.1 What Is Being Claimed

1. **Structural correspondence** between models
2. **Functional equivalence** of components
3. **Vedic completeness** including Western as subset
4. **Therapeutic utility** of integration

### 4.5.2 What Is NOT Being Claimed

1. ~~Historical influence~~ (though Jung knew some Yoga)
2. ~~Vedic supremacy~~ (mutual contribution)
3. ~~Western invalidity~~ (genuine discovery)
4. ~~Religious claim~~ (psychological analysis)

---

## 4.6 Formal Statement

**H_main:** The Vedic Chitta-Antahkarana model provides a complete framework that:
- Encompasses the Freudian unconscious as one layer
- Encompasses the Jungian collective as cosmic dimension
- Maps archetypes to Devas precisely
- Extends to transcendent realization beyond ego integration

**Confidence if confirmed:** 91%
