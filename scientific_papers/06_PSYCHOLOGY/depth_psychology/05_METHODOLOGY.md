## 5.1 Research Approach

### 5.1.1 Comparative Analysis

This study employs **cross-cultural comparative psychology**:
- Systematic comparison of constructs
- Identification of functional equivalences
- Mapping of terminology
- Analysis of therapeutic methods

### 5.1.2 Multi-Source Integration

**Sources analyzed:**
1. Primary texts (Freud, Jung, Patanjali)
2. Secondary interpretations
3. Contemporary research
4. Clinical observations
5. Experiential reports

## 5.2 Data Collection

### 5.2.1 Textual Analysis

**Western Sources:**
| Text | Author | Key Concepts Extracted |
|------|--------|----------------------|
| Interpretation of Dreams | Freud | Unconscious, wish-fulfillment |
| The Ego and the Id | Freud | Id, Ego, Superego |
| Archetypes and Collective Unconscious | Jung | Archetypes, collective |
| Aion | Jung | Self, individuation |

**Vedic Sources:**
| Text | Author/Tradition | Key Concepts Extracted |
|------|------------------|----------------------|
| Yoga Sutras | Patanjali | Chitta, Vrittis, Samskaras |
| Samkhya Karika | Ishvarakrishna | Antahkarana, Gunas |
| Mandukya Upanishad | Vedantic | Four states, Turiya |
| Charaka Samhita | Ayurvedic | Manas, Sattvavajaya |

### 5.2.2 Neuroscientific Evidence

**Studies reviewed:**
- Unconscious processing (Bargh, Dijksterhuis)
- Decision neuroscience (Libet, Soon)
- Meditation effects (Davidson, Lutz)
- Default mode network research

### 5.2.3 Clinical Observations

**Case patterns analyzed:**
- Depth therapy outcomes
- Meditation-based interventions
- Cross-cultural symptom presentations
- Integration case studies

## 5.3 Analytical Framework

### 5.3.1 Correspondence Mapping

**Method:**
1. Identify construct in Western model
2. Define its function, dynamics, pathology
3. Search Vedic texts for functional equivalent
4. Compare definitions, functions, applications
5. Assess degree of correspondence

**Scoring:**
| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 5 | Exact correspondence |
| 4 | Strong functional match |
| 3 | Partial correspondence |
| 2 | Weak similarity |
| 1 | No correspondence |

### 5.3.2 Validation Criteria

Each correspondence must satisfy:
1. **Definitional similarity** — Concepts defined similarly
2. **Functional equivalence** — Serve same psychological function
3. **Dynamic parallelism** — Interact similarly with other components
4. **Clinical applicability** — Similar therapeutic approaches work

### 5.3.3 7-Concept Stack Validation

Every finding validated against:

| # | Concept | Check |
|---|---------|-------|
| 1 | Conservation | Is there psychic energy conservation? |
| 2 | Entropy | Does Tamas/repression increase? |
| 3 | Fractal | Same pattern at different levels? |
| 4 | Karma | Action creates reaction? |
| 5 | Observer | Does observation change? |
| 6 | Cycles | Are there recurring patterns? |
| 7 | Gunas | Can it be classified S/R/T? |

## 5.4 Specific Comparisons

### 5.4.1 Structure Comparison

| Aspect | Freudian | Jungian | Vedic |
|--------|----------|---------|-------|
| Unconscious | Repressed content | + Collective | Chitta (all layers) |
| Ego | Reality mediator | Center of consciousness | Ahamkara |
| Self | N/A | Archetype of wholeness | Atman |
| Drives | Libido, thanatos | Archetypes | Vasanas |

### 5.4.2 Process Comparison

| Process | Western | Vedic |
|---------|---------|-------|
| Repression | Push to unconscious | Samskara burial |
| Association | Linked memories | Samskara chains |
| Defense | Ego protection | Avidya manifestations |
| Integration | Ego-self axis | Yoga (union) |

### 5.4.3 Goal Comparison

| Model | Goal | Method |
|-------|------|--------|
| Freudian | Ego strength | Analysis |
| Jungian | Individuation | Active imagination |
| Vedic | Moksha | Yoga (8 limbs) |

## 5.5 Limitations of Method

### 5.5.1 Translation Challenges

- Sanskrit terms may not have exact English equivalents
- Context changes meaning
- Technical terminology varies

**Mitigation:** Multiple translations consulted, Sanskrit terms preserved

### 5.5.2 Historical Differences

- 2000+ years between Patanjali and Freud
- Different cultural contexts
- Different epistemological frameworks

**Mitigation:** Focus on functional equivalence, not historical identity

### 5.5.3 Experiential Dimension

- Some Vedic concepts require direct experience
- Text analysis cannot capture Samadhi states
- Depth of meaning may be lost

**Mitigation:** Acknowledged as limitation, cited experiential reports

## 5.6 Reliability Measures

### 5.6.1 Cross-Validation

- Multiple scholars' interpretations compared
- Traditional commentaries consulted
- Contemporary translations used

### 5.6.2 Triangulation

- Textual evidence
- Clinical evidence
- Neuroscientific evidence

### 5.6.3 Peer Review

- Findings compared against existing scholarship
- Anomalies noted and addressed
- Alternative interpretations considered
