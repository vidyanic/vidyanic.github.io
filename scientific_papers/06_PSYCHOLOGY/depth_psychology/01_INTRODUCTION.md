## 1.1 The Problem: What Lies Beneath?

Before the late 19th century, Western psychology assumed the mind was largely transparent to itself. Thoughts, feelings, and motivations were considered accessible to introspection. If someone didn't know why they acted a certain way, they simply weren't trying hard enough to remember.

**This assumption was shattered by three discoveries:**

1. **Hypnosis** revealed memories and behaviors inaccessible to normal consciousness
2. **Neurotic symptoms** showed meaningful patterns the patient couldn't explain
3. **Dreams** displayed elaborate content unrelated to waking intentions

Sigmund Freud synthesized these observations into a revolutionary claim: **most of the mind operates unconsciously**.

## 1.2 The Discovery of Depth

### 1.2.1 Freud's Contribution

Freud (1856-1939) proposed:
- The mind has layers (conscious, preconscious, unconscious)
- Repressed material drives behavior without awareness
- Childhood experiences shape adult personality
- Symptoms are meaningful communications from the depths

### 1.2.2 Jung's Extension

Carl Jung (1875-1961) extended this:
- Personal unconscious contains individual repressed material
- **Collective unconscious** contains inherited, universal patterns
- **Archetypes** are these universal patterns (Mother, Father, Hero, Shadow)
- The goal is **individuation** — integration into wholeness

### 1.2.3 The Question Remained

Both Freud and Jung described **what** lies beneath consciousness. But neither could explain:
- Where does the collective unconscious come from?
- Why are archetypes universal?
- What is the ultimate nature of the psyche?
- Is there something beyond the "Self"?

## 1.3 The Vedic Pre-Discovery

Unknown to Freud and Jung, these questions had been answered millennia earlier in the Vedic tradition.

### 1.3.1 Chitta in Yoga Sutras

**Patanjali (c. 400 CE)** describes Chitta (चित्त) as:
- The mind-stuff that stores all impressions
- The substrate of all mental activity
- The repository of Samskaras (impressions) and Vasanas (tendencies)
- What must be stilled for liberation

### 1.3.2 Antahkarana in Samkhya

**The Samkhya system** maps the inner instrument:
- **Chitta** — Memory, unconscious storage
- **Manas** — Processing mind, sense coordination
- **Buddhi** — Intellect, discrimination
- **Ahamkara** — Ego-sense, I-maker

### 1.3.3 Complete Psychology

The Vedic system provides:
- A complete map of mental layers
- The mechanism of impression storage
- The process of purification
- The goal beyond ego — Atman realization

## 1.4 Research Purpose

This paper demonstrates that:

1. **Depth psychology rediscovered Chitta** — Freud and Jung independently arrived at what Yoga psychology has taught for millennia

2. **The correspondence is precise** — Each Western concept maps to a specific Vedic term

3. **The Vedic model is more complete** — It extends beyond ego integration to transcendence

4. **Integration is possible** — Both approaches can enhance therapeutic practice

## 1.5 Scope and Limitations

### 1.5.1 Scope

- Comparing structural models of the psyche
- Mapping terminology across traditions
- Examining therapeutic implications
- Discussing the extension to Moksha

### 1.5.2 Limitations

- Not a historical study of influence (Jung knew some Yoga)
- Not a clinical trial
- Cultural translation challenges acknowledged
- Experiential dimensions cannot be fully captured in text

## 1.7 Significance

If this thesis is correct, then:

1. **Depth psychology is not arbitrary** — It discovered real structures
2. **The Vedic model is scientific** — It maps to empirical psychology
3. **A complete psychology exists** — Integration is possible
4. **The goal extends further** — Beyond wellness to liberation
