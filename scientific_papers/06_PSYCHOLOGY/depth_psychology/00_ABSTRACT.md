## Research Question

Does the Vedic concept of Chitta (चित्त) provide a complete framework that encompasses and extends Western depth psychology's understanding of the unconscious mind?

---

## Thesis Statement

The unconscious mind discovered by Freud and elaborated by Jung is the Chitta of Vedic psychology — the mind-stuff that stores all Samskaras (impressions) and Vasanas (latent tendencies). Jung's archetypes correspond directly to Vedic Devas as universal cosmic patterns. The entire Freudian/Jungian framework exists in complete form within Yoga psychology, which extends further to transcendence (Moksha).

## Key Findings

1. **Structural Correspondence**: Freud's Id/Ego/Superego maps precisely to Tamas-Rajas drives, Ahamkara, and Buddhi
2. **Jungian Completion**: Jung's collective unconscious and archetypes are the Hiranyagarbha (cosmic mind) and Devas
3. **Complete Model**: The Antahkarana (inner instrument) provides a more comprehensive model than Western frameworks
4. **Practical Convergence**: Both traditions agree that awareness heals and integration is the goal
5. **Vedic Extension**: Yoga psychology continues beyond ego health to trans-ego realization (Moksha)

## Methodology

Cross-cultural comparative analysis between:
- Freudian psychoanalysis
- Jungian analytical psychology
- Vedic psychology (Yoga Sutras, Samkhya, Vedanta)
- Contemporary neuroscience of unconscious processing

---

## Significance

This research demonstrates that:
1. Western depth psychology represents a genuine rediscovery of Chitta
2. The Vedic model is more complete and provides the missing "upper floors"
3. Integration of both approaches can enhance therapeutic practice
4. The goal of all depth work is not just ego health but Self-realization
