## 2.1 Freudian Psychoanalysis

### 2.1.1 Primary Sources

**Freud's Major Works:**
- *The Interpretation of Dreams* (1900) — Dream as wish fulfillment
- *The Psychopathology of Everyday Life* (1901) — Slips reveal unconscious
- *Three Essays on Sexuality* (1905) — Libido theory
- *The Ego and the Id* (1923) — Structural model

### 2.1.2 Key Concepts

| Concept | Definition | Vedic Parallel |
|---------|------------|----------------|
| **Unconscious** | Mental content inaccessible to awareness | Chitta (deeper layers) |
| **Repression** | Defense mechanism pushing content down | Samskara suppression |
| **Id** | Pleasure-seeking instincts | Rajas + Tamas drives |
| **Ego** | Reality-testing mediator | Ahamkara |
| **Superego** | Internalized morality | Buddhi (discriminative) |
| **Libido** | Psychic energy | Prana (distorted by Vasanas) |

### 2.1.3 Critique from Vedic Perspective

**Strengths:**
- Recognized unconscious existence
- Understood symptom meaningfulness
- Developed therapeutic method

**Limitations:**
- Reduced to sexuality/aggression
- No transcendent dimension
- Goal is adjustment, not liberation

## 2.2 Jungian Analytical Psychology

### 2.2.1 Primary Sources

**Jung's Major Works:**
- *Symbols of Transformation* (1912) — Break with Freud
- *Psychological Types* (1921) — Introversion/extraversion
- *Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious* (1959) — Core theory
- *Memories, Dreams, Reflections* (1961) — Autobiography with insights

### 2.2.2 Key Concepts

| Concept | Definition | Vedic Parallel |
|---------|------------|----------------|
| **Personal Unconscious** | Individual repressed material | Individual Chitta |
| **Collective Unconscious** | Inherited psychic structures | Hiranyagarbha / Cosmic Mind |
| **Archetypes** | Universal patterns | Devas (cosmic principles) |
| **Shadow** | Rejected aspects of self | Tamas accumulation |
| **Anima/Animus** | Contrasexual element | Shakti/Shiva principles |
| **Self** | Archetype of wholeness | Atman (approached but not realized) |
| **Individuation** | Integration process | Yoga (incomplete) |

### 2.2.3 Jung's Vedic Awareness

Jung was aware of Eastern concepts:
- Studied *Yoga Sutras*
- Wrote commentary on *Secret of the Golden Flower*
- Explored *Tibetan Book of the Dead*
- Corresponded with Indian scholars

**However:** Jung stopped short of accepting Vedic metaphysics, maintaining a psychological rather than spiritual interpretation.

## 2.3 Post-Jungian Developments

### 2.3.1 Archetypal Psychology (Hillman)

James Hillman (1926-2011):
- Archetypes as autonomous images
- "Soul-making" as psychological work
- Multiple perspectives, not mono-myth

### 2.3.2 Object Relations (Klein, Winnicott)

Relational dimensions:
- Early object relationships shape psyche
- Inner representations of others
- The "good enough" mother

### 2.3.3 Transpersonal Psychology

Explicitly bridges:
- Maslow's peak experiences
- Grof's perinatal matrices
- Wilber's integral spectrum

## 2.4 Vedic Sources

### 2.4.1 Yoga Sutras of Patanjali

**Core Text:** ~400 CE compilation of earlier teachings

**Key Sutras on Chitta:**

| Sutra | Sanskrit | Translation | Significance |
|-------|----------|-------------|--------------|
| 1.2 | योगश्चित्तवृत्तिनिरोधः | Yoga is the stilling of Chitta fluctuations | Defines the goal |
| 1.5-11 | वृत्तयः पञ्चतय्यः... | Five types of fluctuations | Maps mental activity |
| 2.3-9 | क्लेशाः... | The five afflictions | Sources of suffering |
| 2.12-14 | क्लेशमूलः कर्माशयः | Afflictions root karma storehouse | Samskara mechanism |

### 2.4.2 Samkhya Karika

**Ishvarakrishna (c. 350 CE):**
- Antahkarana (inner instrument) model
- Manas, Buddhi, Ahamkara, Chitta
- Gunas as psychological forces
- Purusha (witness) vs Prakriti (nature)

### 2.4.3 Vedantic Sources

**Mandukya Upanishad:**
- Four states: Jagrat, Svapna, Sushupti, Turiya
- Consciousness beyond mind

**Brihadaranyaka Upanishad:**

## 2.5 Contemporary Research

### 2.5.1 Unconscious Processing

**Neuroscience confirms:**
- Most neural processing is unconscious
- Decisions often made before awareness
- Priming effects demonstrate implicit memory
- Dual-process theories (System 1/System 2)

**Key Studies:**
- Libet (1983) — Readiness potential precedes awareness
- Dijksterhuis (2004) — Unconscious thought theory
- Bargh (2008) — Automaticity of social behavior

### 2.5.2 Cross-Cultural Psychology

**Archetypal universality:**
- Campbell's monomyth across cultures
- Cross-cultural dream symbols
- Universal facial expressions (Ekman)
- Shared mythological motifs

### 2.5.3 Meditation Research

**Neuroimaging of meditators:**
- Altered default mode network
- Increased prefrontal activity
- Changes in Chitta-like processes
- Experienced meditators show distinct patterns

## 2.6 Synthesis of Literature

| Domain | Western View | Vedic View | Integration |
|--------|--------------|------------|-------------|
| **Structure** | Id-Ego-Superego | Antahkarana (4-fold) | Vedic more comprehensive |
| **Content** | Repressed + inherited | Samskaras + Vasanas | Same phenomenon |
| **Process** | Defense mechanisms | Vrittis (fluctuations) | Compatible models |
| **Goal** | Ego integration | Moksha (liberation) | Vedic extends further |
| **Evidence** | Clinical + neuro | Experiential + textual | Converging validation |

---

## 2.7 Gap in Literature

**Missing in Western literature:**
1. Complete integration of Vedic psychology
2. Recognition of transcendent dimension
3. Understanding of Samskara mechanics
4. Moksha as therapeutic endpoint

**This paper addresses these gaps.**
