## 5.1 Approach Overview

```
METHODOLOGY:
============

1. TEXTUAL ANALYSIS
   Compare Arjuna's Vishada symptoms with DSM-5 criteria

2. LITERATURE CORRELATION
   Map purpose/meaning research to Dharma concept

3. NEUROSCIENCE INTEGRATION
   Flow states, DMN, purpose-brain relationships

4. CLINICAL OBSERVATION
   Patterns in anxiety presentation

5. 7-CONCEPT VALIDATION
   Apply standard validation stack
```

## 5.2 Textual Analysis Method

### 5.2.1 Arjuna's Symptoms (BG 1.28-46)

| Sanskrit | Transliteration | English | DSM-5 Equivalent |
|----------|-----------------|---------|------------------|
| सीदन्ति गात्राणि | Sidanti gatrani | Limbs failing | Weakness/trembling |
| मुखं परिशुष्यति | Mukham parishushyati | Mouth drying | Dry mouth |
| वेपथुः | Vepathuh | Trembling | Tremor |
| रोमहर्षः | Romaharsah | Hair standing | Chills/sweating |
| त्वक् परिदह्यते | Tvak paridahyate | Skin burning | Flushing |
| भ्रमति मनः | Bhramati manah | Mind whirling | Racing thoughts |
| न शक्नोमि अवस्थातुम् | Na shaknomi avasthatum | Cannot stand | Motor agitation |
| विपरीतानि | Viparitani | Things seem reversed | Derealization |

### 5.2.2 DSM-5 Panic Attack Criteria

Cross-reference with:
- Palpitations, trembling, sweating
- Shortness of breath, chest pain
- Nausea, dizziness
- Derealization, fear of losing control
- Numbness, chills/hot flushes

## 5.3 Purpose-Anxiety Correlation

### 5.3.1 Instruments

| Measure | What it Assesses |
|---------|------------------|
| Purpose in Life (PIL) Scale | Meaning/direction |
| Life Engagement Test (LET) | Meaningful activity |
| Meaning in Life Questionnaire (MLQ) | Presence/search for meaning |
| Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) | Anxiety symptoms |
| State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) | Anxiety levels |

### 5.3.2 Analysis

```
CORRELATION:
============

r = Σ[(Purpose_score - Mean_P) × (Anxiety_score - Mean_A)] / (n × SD_P × SD_A)

EXPECTED: Strong negative correlation (r < -0.5)
```

## 5.4 Neuroscience Integration

### 5.4.1 Brain Imaging Studies

| Comparison | Expected Finding |
|------------|------------------|
| Flow vs Anxiety | Different network activation |
| Purpose high vs low | Different baseline activity |
| DMN in anxiety | Hyperactive |
| DMN in flow | Suppressed |

### 5.4.2 Dharma-Brain Mapping

| Dharma State | Brain State | Anxiety Level |
|--------------|-------------|---------------|
| Svadharma (aligned) | Task-positive dominant | Low |
| Paradharma (misaligned) | Default-mode dominant | High |
| Confusion | Neither integrated | Very high |
| Clarity | Both integrated | Minimal |

## 5.5 7-Concept Validation

| Concept | Test Question | Expected |
|---------|---------------|----------|
| Conservation | Energy conserved in anxiety? | Yes (redirected) |
| Entropy | Anxiety increases disorder? | Yes (Tamas) |
| Fractal | Same pattern at all scales? | Yes (individual to societal) |
| Karma | Action-consequence in anxiety? | Yes (Paradharma -> Anxiety) |
| Observer | Awareness affects anxiety? | Yes (meta-awareness helps) |
| Cycles | Anxiety cycles exist? | Yes (episodes, patterns) |
| Gunas | Classifiable as S/R/T? | Yes (R/T dominant in anxiety) |
