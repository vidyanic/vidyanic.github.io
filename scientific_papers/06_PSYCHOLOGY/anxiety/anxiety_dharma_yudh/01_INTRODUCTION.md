## 1.1 The Anxiety Epidemic

```
GLOBAL ANXIETY STATISTICS (2024):
=================================

• 301 million people with anxiety disorders worldwide
• 31% of US adults experience anxiety at some point
• Anxiety is the most common mental health condition
• Rates have doubled since 2008
• Youth anxiety has increased 20% in decade

DESPITE:
• More medications than ever
• More therapists than ever
• More awareness than ever

WHY ISN'T IT WORKING?
```

## 1.2 Standard Model Limitations

Current anxiety treatment focuses on:

| Approach | Target | Problem |
|----------|--------|---------|
| SSRIs | Serotonin levels | Addresses symptom, not cause |
| Benzodiazepines | GABA receptors | Temporary, addictive |
| CBT | Thought patterns | Cognitive, ignores existential |
| Exposure therapy | Fear conditioning | Behavioral, ignores meaning |

**Missing: THE ROOT CAUSE — What is the body RESPONDING to?**

## 1.3 Backend Framework Proposal

> **"स्वधर्मे निधनं श्रेयः परधर्मो भयावहः"**
> "Better is death in one's own Dharma; the Dharma of another is full of fear."
> — Bhagavad Gita 3.35

The Backend Framework proposes:

```
ANXIETY = DHARMA YUDH (Internal War)
====================================

When you live Paradharma (against your nature):
• Body perceives continuous threat (to authentic self)
• Fight-or-flight activates chronically
• Mind generates warning signals (worry, rumination)
• Emotions signal danger (fear, dread)

THE THREAT IS REAL — You ARE under attack.
The attacker is the false life you're living.
```

## 1.4 The Arjuna Case Study

Bhagavad Gita Chapter 1 describes Arjuna's Vishada (anxiety/despondency):

```
ARJUNA'S SYMPTOMS (BG 1.28-30):
===============================

• सीदन्ति मम गात्राणि (Sidanti mama gatrani) — My limbs are failing
• मुखं च परिशुष्यति (Mukham cha parishushyati) — My mouth is drying
• वेपथुश्च शरीरे मे (Vepathush cha sharire me) — Trembling in my body
• रोमहर्षश्च जायते (Romaharshas cha jayate) — Hair standing on end
• गाण्डीवं स्रंसते हस्तात् (Gandivam sransate hastat) — Bow slipping from hand
• त्वक्चैव परिदह्यते (Tvak chaiva paridahyate) — Skin is burning
• न च शक्नोम्यवस्थातुम् (Na cha shaknomy avasthatum) — Cannot stand still
• भ्रमतीव च मे मनः (Bhramativa cha me manah) — Mind is whirling

MODERN DIAGNOSIS: Panic Attack with Generalized Anxiety
```

## 1.5 The Dharma Conflict

Arjuna's conflict was:

| Svadharma | Paradharma |
|-----------|------------|
| Kshatriya (warrior) | Emotional pacifist |
| Duty to fight | Attachment to family |
| Dharmic action | Moha (delusion) |

The Gita's 18 chapters = Anxiety treatment protocol.

## 1.6 Research Objectives

1. Map anxiety symptoms to Dharma conflict
2. Analyze Arjuna's Vishada as clinical case
3. Correlate Svadharma-alignment with anxiety relief
4. Propose Dharma-based treatment protocols
5. Validate through 7-concept stack
