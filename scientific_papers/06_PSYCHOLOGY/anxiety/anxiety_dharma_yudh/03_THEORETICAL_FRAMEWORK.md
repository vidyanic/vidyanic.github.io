# 3. THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK

---

## 3.1 The Dharma Conflict Model

### 3.1.1 Core Structure

```
ANXIETY = f(Svadharma, Paradharma, Conflict_Intensity)

WHERE:
• Svadharma = Your authentic nature, purpose, calling
• Paradharma = Roles/expectations not aligned with Svadharma
• Conflict_Intensity = Degree of mismatch

FORMULA:
Anxiety_Level = k × |Paradharma_Load - Svadharma_Expression|

k = Individual sensitivity factor
```

### 3.1.2 The Conflict Spectrum

```
FULLY ALIGNED (Svadharma)          FULLY MISALIGNED (Paradharma)
         |                                    |
         v                                    v
    +---------+                         +---------+
    |  PEACE  | <----------------------> | ANXIETY |
    |  FLOW   |                         | PANIC   |
    | PURPOSE |                         | DESPAIR |
    +---------+                         +---------+
    
Most people live somewhere in between.
The closer to Paradharma, the more anxiety.
```

## 3.2 Svadharma Components

### 3.2.1 What Determines Svadharma?

```
SVADHARMA = f(Varna, Guna, Karma, Kala)

WHERE:
• Varna (वर्ण) = Natural temperament/aptitude
• Guna (गुण) = Quality balance (Sattva/Rajas/Tamas)
• Karma (कर्म) = Accumulated tendencies
• Kala (काल) = Current life stage (Ashrama)

Not caste — NATURE.
```

### 3.2.2 The Four Varnas (Temperaments)

| Varna | Nature | Modern Expression |
|-------|--------|-------------------|
| Brahmana | Knowledge, teaching | Teachers, researchers, philosophers |
| Kshatriya | Protection, leadership | Military, police, executives, athletes |
| Vaishya | Trade, production | Entrepreneurs, farmers, merchants |
| Shudra | Service, craft | Artisans, service workers, technicians |

**Everyone has a Varna — determined by nature, not birth.**

### 3.2.3 Mismatched Varna = Anxiety

```
EXAMPLE:
=========

Natural Varna: Brahmana (loves learning, teaching)
Forced Role: Corporate sales (Vaishya activity)

RESULT:
• Daily activities conflict with nature
• Body signals "wrong path" constantly
• Chronic anxiety, burnout
• Eventual crisis or illness
```

## 3.3 Paradharma Sources

### 3.3.1 Common Sources

| Source | Type | Example |
|--------|------|---------|
| Family expectations | External | "You must be a doctor" |
| Cultural norms | External | "Success = money" |
| Ego/Image | Internal | "I should be more..." |
| Fear | Internal | "I can't pursue my passion" |
| Ignorance | Internal | "I don't know my Svadharma" |

### 3.3.2 The Paradharma Trap

```
TRAP SEQUENCE:
==============

1. Accept Paradharma (for safety, approval, money)
2. Suppress Svadharma signals (ignore passion, calling)
3. Body begins warning (anxiety symptoms)
4. Interpret as "mental illness"
5. Suppress symptoms (medications, distractions)
6. Deeper conflict (depression, crisis, illness)
7. Either:
   a. Break down (forced change), or
   b. Wake up (conscious change)
```

---

## 3.4 Anxiety as Alarm System

### 3.4.1 Anxiety is NOT the Problem

```
REFRAME:
========

Anxiety is not a "disorder" — it's an ALARM.

Like:
• Pain signals tissue damage
• Fever signals infection
• Hunger signals nutrient need

ANXIETY signals Dharma misalignment.

Suppressing the alarm doesn't fix the fire.
```

### 3.4.2 Symptom-Purpose Mapping

| Symptom | Purpose | Message |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Worry | Future scanning | "This path leads nowhere good" |
| Rumination | Past processing | "You made wrong choices" |
| Panic | Acute warning | "STOP. This is urgent." |
| Dread | General alarm | "Everything is wrong" |
| Restlessness | Action signal | "Do something different" |

## 3.5 The Gita Treatment Model

### 3.5.1 Krishna's Approach

```
ARJUNA'S TREATMENT (Gita Chapters 1-18):
========================================

1. LISTEN TO DISTRESS (Chapter 1)
   • Let symptoms express fully
   • Don't suppress or shame

2. CLARIFY REALITY (Chapters 2-3)
   • Who are you really? (Atman)
   • What is your Dharma?

3. PROVIDE FRAMEWORK (Chapters 4-6)
   • Karma Yoga, Jnana Yoga, Dhyana Yoga
   • Multiple paths to alignment

4. SHOW COSMIC VISION (Chapter 11)
   • Bigger picture, reduced ego
   • Individual role in whole

5. GUIDE ACTION (Chapters 12-18)
   • Practical steps
   • Surrender of fruits

RESULT: Arjuna's anxiety resolved.
"करिष्ये वचनं तव" — "I shall do as you say."
