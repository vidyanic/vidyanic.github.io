# 2. LITERATURE REVIEW

## 2.1 Modern Anxiety Research

### 2.1.1 Biological Models

| Theory | Mechanism | Limitation |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| Serotonin hypothesis | Low 5-HT causes anxiety | SSRIs only 50% effective |
| GABA hypothesis | Low GABA = hyperexcitability | Benzos are addictive |
| HPA axis dysregulation | Chronic cortisol elevation | Why is it dysregulated? |
| Amygdala hyperactivity | Overactive threat detection | What triggers it? |

**All describe HOW but not WHY.**

### 2.1.2 Psychological Models

| Theory | Focus | Limitation |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Cognitive (Beck) | Distorted thoughts | Thoughts are symptoms too |
| Behavioral | Learned fear responses | Ignores meaning/purpose |
| Psychodynamic | Unconscious conflict | Abstract, hard to test |
| Existential | Meaning/death anxiety | Closest to Dharma model |

### 2.1.3 Existential Approaches

Viktor Frankl (Logotherapy):
> "He who has a WHY to live can bear almost any HOW."

Rollo May:
> "Anxiety is the experience of Being affirming itself against Nonbeing."

Irvin Yalom:
> Four existential concerns: Death, Freedom, Isolation, Meaninglessness

**These approach the Dharma concept but lack systematic framework.**

## 2.2 Purpose and Anxiety

### 2.2.1 Research Findings

| Study | Finding |
|-------|---------|
| Ryff (1989) | Purpose in life = lower anxiety |
| Steger (2006) | Meaning protects against anxiety |
| Kashdan (2009) | Curiosity/purpose = anxiety resilience |
| King (2006) | Life goals = psychological wellbeing |
| McKnight (2009) | Purpose = better stress response |

### 2.2.2 The Purpose Gap

```
PARADOX:
=========

More people than ever are:
• Educated
• Materially comfortable
• Entertained

Yet more people than ever have:
• No clear purpose
• No meaningful work
• No connection to larger meaning

RESULT: Anxiety epidemic
```

## 2.3 Backend Framework Sources

### 2.3.1 Arjuna's Vishada (BG Chapter 1)

> **"विषीदन्तमिदं वाक्यमुवाच मधुसूदनः"**
> "To him who was thus overcome with pity and despondency, Madhusudana spoke..."
> — Bhagavad Gita 2.1

Vishada = Despondency/Anxiety = Result of Dharma confusion

### 2.3.2 Svadharma vs Paradharma

> **"श्रेयान्स्वधर्मो विगुणः परधर्मात्स्वनुष्ठितात्"**
> "Better is one's own Dharma, though imperfectly performed, than the Dharma of another well performed."
> — Bhagavad Gita 3.35

| Concept | Definition | Anxiety Relation |
|---------|------------|------------------|
| Svadharma | One's own nature/duty | Living this = Peace |
| Paradharma | Another's nature/duty | Living this = Fear |
| Vishada | Despondency/anxiety | Result of conflict |
| Moha | Delusion | Causes wrong choice |

### 2.3.3 Karma Yoga Solution

> **"कर्मण्येवाधिकारस्ते मा फलेषु कदाचन"**
> "You have the right to action alone, not to its fruits."
> — Bhagavad Gita 2.47

**Action aligned with Dharma, without attachment = Freedom from anxiety**

## 2.4 Neuroscience of Purpose

### 2.4.1 Flow States

Csikszentmihalyi's Flow:
- Complete absorption in aligned activity
- Time distortion (slows/speeds)
- Effortless concentration
- Intrinsic motivation

**Flow = Svadharma in action = No anxiety**

### 2.4.2 Brain States

| State | Activity | Experience |
|-------|----------|------------|
| Default Mode Network | High (unoccupied) | Rumination, anxiety |
| Task-Positive Network | High (engaged) | Flow, no anxiety |
| Integrated | Both balanced | Wisdom, clarity |

**Anxiety = DMN dominant = No Dharmic engagement**

## 2.5 Research Gap

**Modern psychiatry:** Treats symptoms (neurotransmitters, cognitions)

**Existential therapy:** Approaches meaning but lacks systematic framework

**Backend Framework:** Provides complete model (Svadharma-Paradharma) with treatment protocol (Gita)

**This paper:** Bridges the gap with testable, clinical applications
