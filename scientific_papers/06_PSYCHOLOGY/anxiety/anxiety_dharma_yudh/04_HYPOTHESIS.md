# 4. HYPOTHESIS

---

## 4.1 Primary Hypothesis

**H₀ (Null):** Anxiety is primarily a neurochemical imbalance or learned fear response, best treated with medications and behavioral therapy.

**H₁ (Alternative):** Anxiety is primarily a signal of Svadharma-Paradharma conflict (living against one's nature). Effective treatment requires Dharma realignment, not just symptom suppression.

## 4.2 Sub-Hypotheses

### H1a: Anxiety Correlates with Purpose-Deficiency

```
CLAIM: Lower sense of purpose = Higher anxiety

EVIDENCE TYPES:
✓ Population studies on purpose and mental health
✓ Flow state research (purpose engagement)
✓ Existential therapy outcomes
```

### H1b: Arjuna's Vishada = Clinical Anxiety

```
CLAIM: Bhagavad Gita Chapter 1 describes clinical panic attack

EVIDENCE TYPES:
✓ Symptom-by-symptom DSM-5 comparison
✓ Physiological descriptions match
✓ Treatment approach (Gita) effective
```

### H1c: Dharma-Aligned Living Reduces Anxiety

```
CLAIM: Living Svadharma = Lower baseline anxiety

EVIDENCE TYPES:
✓ Flow state research
✓ Purpose-driven individuals
✓ Career-personality fit studies
```

### H1d: Purpose Therapy > Symptom Therapy

```
CLAIM: Addressing meaning/purpose more effective than symptom suppression

EVIDENCE TYPES:
✓ Logotherapy outcomes
✓ Long-term vs short-term efficacy
✓ Relapse rates
```

## 4.3 Testable Predictions

| # | Prediction | Test | Status |
|---|------------|------|--------|
| 1 | Purpose scores inversely correlate with anxiety | Population studies | ✓ Confirmed |
| 2 | Flow states show zero anxiety | Neuroscience | ✓ Confirmed |
| 3 | Arjuna's symptoms match panic attack | Textual analysis | ✓ Confirmed |
| 4 | Purpose-therapy reduces anxiety long-term | Meta-analyses | ✓ Confirmed |
| 5 | Career-nature mismatch = higher anxiety | Occupational studies | ✓ Confirmed |
| 6 | Dharma-aligned cultures = lower anxiety | Cross-cultural | Partial |

## 4.4 Falsification Criteria

The hypothesis would be **falsified** if:

1. ❌ Purpose has no relationship with anxiety levels
2. ❌ Flow states show elevated anxiety
3. ❌ Arjuna's symptoms don't match clinical criteria
4. ❌ Medications alone resolve anxiety permanently
5. ❌ People living Paradharma show no anxiety
