## APPENDIX C: BIRTHMARK STATISTICS

### Stevenson's Dataset

```
TOTAL BIRTHMARK CASES: 200+

LOCATION CORRELATION:
• Within 10 cm of wound: 88%
• Shape similarity: 75%
• Multiple birthmarks matching multiple wounds: 30 cases

WOUND TYPES:
• Gunshot: 45%
• Knife/sword: 25%
• Other trauma: 30%
```

### Probability Calculation

```
RANDOM PROBABILITY:

Given:
• Body surface area ≈ 18,000 cm²
• Average birthmark size ≈ 1-2 cm²
• Wound at specific location

P(birthmark at exact wound location) = 2/18,000 = 1/9,000
P(shape match) ≈ 1/100

P(combined) = 1/900,000

With 200+ cases matching:
Combined probability against chance = essentially zero
```
