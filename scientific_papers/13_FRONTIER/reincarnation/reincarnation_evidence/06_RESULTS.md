## 6.3 BIRTHMARK EVIDENCE

### Statistical Overview

```
STEVENSON'S BIRTHMARK STUDY:
• 200+ cases documented
• Medical records of wounds obtained
• Photographs of birthmarks taken
• Location correspondence measured

FINDINGS:
• Average distance from wound to birthmark: < 10 cm
• Shape correspondence: Often exact
• Multiple marks: Some cases have 2-3 matching
```

### Specific Cases

**Turkish Boy:**
- Born with deformed ear
- Claimed life as man killed by shotgun to head
- Medical records: Previous person shot in ear
- Match: Exact location and shape

**Indian Boy:**
- Five birthmarks on chest
- Claimed life as man shot five times
- Autopsy records: Five bullet wounds
- Match: All five locations correspond

### Statistical Analysis

```
PROBABILITY CALCULATION (Stevenson):

Random birthmark at specific location: 1/160
Matching shape:                        1/1000
Combined single match:                 1/160,000
Multiple matches in same case:         Astronomical

CONCLUSION: Cannot be explained by chance.
