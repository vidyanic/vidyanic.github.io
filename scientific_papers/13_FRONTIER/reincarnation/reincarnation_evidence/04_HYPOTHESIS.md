# 04. HYPOTHESES — Testable Predictions

---

## 4.1 PRIMARY HYPOTHESIS

**H₁: Consciousness (Atman) survives bodily death and can transfer to a new body, carrying memories, impressions, and physical markers.**

### Predictions

| Prediction | Test |
|------------|------|
| Children will report accurate past-life details | Verify claims before/after |
| Details will be verifiable | Match to deceased person |
| No normal source of information | Rule out learning |
| Cross-cultural occurrence | Document across belief systems |

## 4.2 SECONDARY HYPOTHESES

### H₂: Memories transfer via Samskaras

**Prediction:** Stronger emotional experiences (especially traumatic deaths) will produce clearer memories in next life.

**Evidence required:**
- Correlation between trauma intensity and memory clarity
- Violent deaths overrepresented in cases with memories

### H₃: Birthmarks reflect fatal wounds

**Prediction:** Children claiming past lives will have birthmarks matching documented wounds on the deceased.

**Evidence required:**
- Medical records of deceased wound location
- Statistical correlation with birthmark location
- Odds far exceed chance

### H₄: Behaviors correlate with past life

**Prediction:** Unexplained phobias, skills, and preferences in children will match the previous personality's life.

**Evidence required:**
- Phobia matching death circumstance (drowning -> water fear)
- Skills matching occupation
- Preferences matching habits

### H₅: Recognition is accurate

**Prediction:** Children taken to previous location will recognize people, places, and objects.

**Evidence required:**
- Blind testing conditions
- Accurate identification
- Knows details only previous person knew

## 4.3 NULL HYPOTHESES

**H₀₁:** All past-life memories are fantasy or coincidence.

**H₀₂:** Birthmarks are random and any correlation is spurious.

**H₀₃:** Information was acquired through normal (though unremembered) channels.

**H₀₄:** Parents consciously or unconsciously coach children.

## 4.4 FALSIFICATION CRITERIA

The reincarnation hypothesis would be falsified if:

1. **No verified cases** — All claims proven false when investigated
2. **All information accessible** — Normal explanation for knowledge
3. **Random birthmarks** — No statistical correlation with wounds
4. **Cultural only** — Occurs only in believing cultures
5. **Age independence** — Occurs equally in adults (not just young children)

## 4.5 STRENGTH SCALE

Tucker developed a scale to measure case strength:

| Criterion | Max Score |
|-----------|-----------|
| Statements recorded before identification | 4 |
| Matching birthmarks | 4 |
| Recognition tests passed | 4 |
| Verification of unusual details | 4 |
| No normal explanation | 4 |
| **Maximum** | **20** |

Cases scoring 15+ are considered strong.
