# 03. THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK — What Reincarnates

---

## 3.1 THE BACKEND MODEL OF REBIRTH

### The Atman-Body Relationship

```
ATMAN (आत्मन्) — Pure Consciousness
|
+-- CARRIES:
|   +-- Samskaras (संस्कार) — Deep impressions
|   +-- Vasanas (वासना) — Latent tendencies
|   +-- Karma (कर्म) — Action-consequence load
|   +-- Sometimes: Memories (usually blocked)
|
+-- INTERFACES WITH:
    +-- Subtle Body (Linga Sharira)
    +-- Physical Body (Sthula Sharira)

REBIRTH = Atman + accumulated impressions -> New body
```

## 3.2 WHAT TRANSFERS

### Full Model

| Component | Transfers? | Description |
|-----------|------------|-------------|
| **Atman** | ✅ Always | Pure consciousness, the witness |
| **Samskaras** | ✅ Always | Deep impressions from experiences |
| **Vasanas** | ✅ Always | Tendencies, preferences |
| **Karma** | ✅ Always | Unresolved action-consequences |
| **Memories** | ⚠️ Sometimes | Usually blocked, sometimes leak |
| **Personality** | ⚠️ Partial | Shaped by samskaras + new environment |
| **Brain** | ❌ Never | Dies with body |
| **Body** | ❌ Never | Dies and decays |

### Why Only Some Remember

```
"FORGETFULNESS" MECHANISM:
===========================

1. BIRTH TRAUMA — Intense experience overwrites
2. NEW HARDWARE — Brain is fresh, no stored memories
3. DESIGN FEATURE — Clean slate for learning
4. KARMA BALANCE — Full memory would interfere with lessons

WHO REMEMBERS:
• Young children (2-5) — New brain hasn't fully suppressed
• Strong impressions — Traumatic deaths leave deeper marks
• Incomplete closure — Unfinished business
• High Sattva souls — More conscious connection maintained
```

## 3.3 THE SAMSKARA MECHANISM

### Impression Formation

```
LIFE EVENTS -> SAMSKARAS -> CARRY TO NEXT LIFE

Strong emotions + repeated patterns = Deep samskaras

EXAMPLES:
• Traumatic death -> Fear of similar circumstances
• Intense skill practice -> Innate ability
• Strong attachments -> Draw to similar people
• Unresolved issues -> Patterns repeat
```

### Types of Transfer

| Type | Manifestation | Evidence |
|------|---------------|----------|
| **Memory fragments** | Specific recall | Verified statements |
| **Behavioral patterns** | Unexplained habits | Match previous life |
| **Skills** | Innate abilities | Prodigies |
| **Phobias** | Unexplained fears | Match death circumstances |
| **Physical marks** | Birthmarks | Match wounds |
| **Attractions** | Draw to places/people | Recognition |

## 3.4 BIRTHMARK MECHANISM

### The Physical Evidence Problem

How can wounds on one body appear as birthmarks on another?

```
HYPOTHESIS (Backend Framework):
===============================

1. SUBTLE BODY CARRIES IMPRINT
   • Wounds create deep trauma samskaras
   • These exist at subtle body level
   • Not physical but informational

2. SUBTLE BODY -> PHYSICAL BODY
   • At conception, subtle body enters
   • Carries template information
   • Physical development influenced

3. MANIFESTATION
   • Samskara imprint affects tissue formation
   • Result: Birthmark at corresponding location
   • Most strong with violent/traumatic death

ANALOGY:
Like software bug that persists across hardware upgrades
```

### Medical Correlation

```
STEVENSON'S DOCUMENTATION:
• Medical records of deceased obtained
• Wound location precisely documented
• Birthmark location on child measured
• Correlation: Often exact match

ODDS CALCULATION:
• Random birthmark at specific location: ~1/160
• Matching shape: ~1/1000
• Combined: ~1/160,000
• Multiple marks: Astronomical odds
```

## 3.5 INTERVAL BETWEEN LIVES

### The Bardo Period

```
FROM BACKEND FRAMEWORK:
=======================

1. DEATH (Pralaya)
   • Atman withdraws from sheaths
   • Subtle body separates
   • Physical body returns to elements

2. INTERMEDIATE STATE (Antarabhava/Bardo)
   • Consciousness exists without physical body
   • Duration: Varies (days to decades)
   • Processing of previous life
   • Karmic attraction to next parents

3. CONCEPTION (New Srishti)
   • Atman attracted to parents by karma
   • Subtle body enters developing embryo
   • Physical body forms around template
   • New life begins
```

### Research Data on Interval

| Culture | Typical Interval Claimed |
|---------|-------------------------|
| India | Average: 18 months |
| USA | Average: 4.5 years |
| Burma | Variable |

**Note:** These are claimed intervals; verification is difficult.

## 3.6 RELATIONSHIP TO DEATH MECHANICS

### Continuation from Previous Paper

```
DEATH -> REBIRTH SEQUENCE:
=========================

T-72h:  Atman begins withdrawal
T-0:    Clinical death (Prana exits)
T+:     Subtle body fully separates

INTERMEDIATE:
• Atman + subtle body exist independently
• Samskaras/karma determine next destination
• Duration varies

REBIRTH:
• Karmic attraction to parents
• Conception creates new physical vehicle
• Atman enters (timing debated)
• New life begins

CYCLE CONTINUES until Moksha
```

## 3.7 FRACTAL VALIDATION

### Pattern at All Scales

```
✅ COSMIC: Brahman -> Universes -> Dissolution -> New creation
✅ STAR: Supernova -> Elements -> New star formation
✅ HUMAN: Death -> Bardo -> Rebirth
✅ CELL: Apoptosis -> Materials recycled -> New cell
✅ SEASONS: Winter death -> Spring rebirth

UNIVERSAL PATTERN:
Form -> Dissolution -> Re-formation
Information preserved through transitions
```
