# 05. METHODOLOGY — Research Approach

## 5.1 THE STEVENSON-TUCKER PROTOCOL

### Step 1: Initial Report

```
SOURCES OF CASES:
• Parents contact researcher
• Local informants (in cultures where common)
• Medical professionals
• News reports

CRITERIA FOR INVESTIGATION:
• Child under 7 (ideally 2-5)
• Spontaneous statements (not prompted)
• Specific enough to verify
• Family willing to cooperate
```

### Step 2: Documentation Before Verification

```
CRITICAL STEP:
• Record all statements BEFORE searching
• Written, witnessed documentation
• Prevents retrofit or contamination
• Creates verifiable prediction
```

### Step 3: Search for Previous Personality

```
METHODS:
• Use statements to identify location
• Search records for matching deceased
• Contact family of potential match
• Independent verification
```

### Step 4: Verification

```
VERIFICATION CHECKLIST:
□ Name matches?
□ Location correct?
□ Death circumstances accurate?
□ Family details verified?
□ Unusual details confirmed?
□ Timeline consistent?
□ No normal source of information?
```

### Step 5: Additional Testing

```
IF POSSIBLE:
• Recognition tests (blind)
• Behavioral observation
• Birthmark documentation
• Psychological assessment
```

## 5.2 TYPES OF EVIDENCE

### 5.2.1 Verbal Statements

| Criterion | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Specific | Names, places, dates |
| Verifiable | Can be checked |
| Unusual | Not commonly known |
| Recorded early | Before investigation |

### 5.2.2 Birthmarks

```
DOCUMENTATION:
• Photograph birthmark
• Measure location precisely
• Obtain medical records of deceased
• Compare wound location to birthmark
• Statistical analysis
```

### 5.2.3 Recognition Tests

```
PROTOCOL:
• Bring child to previous location (if possible)
• Do NOT provide cues
• Ask child to identify people/objects
• Record accuracy
• Look for knowing details only previous person knew
```

### 5.2.4 Behavioral Evidence

```
OBSERVATIONS:
• Phobias unexplained by current life
• Skills unusual for background
• Preferences/habits
• Emotional responses
• Personality traits
```

## 5.3 VALIDATION FRAMEWORK

### Multi-Source Verification

| Source | Weight |
|--------|--------|
| Medical records | 30% |
| Family testimony | 25% |
| Official documents | 20% |
| Physical evidence (birthmarks) | 15% |
| Independent witnesses | 10% |

### Confidence Calculation

```
Case_Confidence = Σ(Source_Weight × Source_Score)

WHERE:
Source_Score ∈ [0,1] — How strong the evidence is
```

## 5.4 CONTROLLING FOR BIAS

### Potential Biases

| Bias | Control |
|------|---------|
| **Parental leading** | Record statements before investigation |
| **Cultural expectation** | Study in skeptical cultures |
| **Confirmation bias** | Document negative results too |
| **Selection bias** | Systematic collection methods |
| **Memory distortion** | Early documentation |

### Independent Verification

```
WHENEVER POSSIBLE:
• Multiple researchers
• Blind verification
• Independent record checks
• Cross-cultural comparison
```

## 5.5 DATA SOURCES FOR THIS PAPER

### Primary Sources

1. **Stevenson archive** — 2,500+ cases
2. **Tucker database** — 2,500+ cases
3. **Published books and papers** — Peer-reviewed
4. **Medical records** — Wound documentation
5. **Family interviews** — First-hand accounts

### Analysis Methods

```
1. CASE STRENGTH ASSESSMENT
   • Apply Tucker scale
   • Categorize by evidence type

2. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
   • Birthmark correlation
   • Cultural distribution
   • Age patterns

3. PATTERN ANALYSIS
   • Common features across cases
   • Interval statistics
   • Death type correlation
```

## 5.6 LIMITATIONS

### What We Cannot Do

1. **Induce reincarnation** — Cannot experimentally create
2. **Follow a soul** — Cannot track consciousness
3. **Eliminate all explanations** — Some remain theoretical
4. **Prove mechanism** — Only observe correlations

### Mitigation

- Use multiple independent cases
- Focus on verifiable elements
- Acknowledge uncertainty
- Calculate confidence honestly
