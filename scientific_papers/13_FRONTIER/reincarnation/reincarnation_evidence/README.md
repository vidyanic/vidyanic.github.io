## ❓ QUESTIONS ANSWERED

1. **Is there scientific evidence for reincarnation?**
   -> Yes: 5,000+ documented cases with verified details

2. **How do children know things about deceased people?**
   -> Consciousness (Atman) carries memories between lives via subtle body

3. **Why do birthmarks match wounds on deceased?**
   -> Traumatic death creates imprint in subtle body -> affects new physical development

4. **Why don't most people remember past lives?**
   -> Design feature: birth trauma overwrites, filter develops by age 7-8

5. **Is this just cultural belief?**
   -> No: Occurs in skeptical cultures (USA, Europe) with same pattern

## 📊 QUICK SUMMARY

```
THE EVIDENCE:
=============

5,000+ CASES DOCUMENTED (Stevenson, Tucker)
+-- Verified verbal statements: 3,000+
+-- Birthmark correlations: 200+
+-- Recognition tests passed: 500+
+-- Strong cases (15+/20): 300+

UNIVERSAL PATTERN:
+-- Age of statements: 2-5 years
+-- Fades by: 7-8 years
+-- Occurs in: ALL cultures
+-- Birthmarks: Match wounds (odds: billions to one)

NO NORMAL EXPLANATION WORKS:
❌ Fantasy (too specific, verified)
❌ Coaching (parents often don't know)
❌ Fraud (decades of investigation)
❌ Cryptomnesia (no access to info)
