# 02. LITERATURE REVIEW — Reincarnation Research History

---

## 2.1 ANCIENT TRADITIONS

### Vedic Understanding

```
PUNARJANMA (पुनर्जन्म) — Rebirth

Key texts:
• Bhagavad Gita — Chapter 2 (Atman's journey)
• Katha Upanishad — Nature of Atman
• Garuda Purana — Rebirth mechanics
• Yoga Sutras — Samskara theory
```

**Core teaching:** Atman (consciousness) takes many bodies, carrying Samskaras (impressions), until achieving Moksha (liberation).

### Other Traditions

| Tradition | Teaching |
|-----------|----------|
| Buddhism | Rebirth, not self, but continuity of consciousness |
| Jainism | Jiva travels through bodies |
| Ancient Greek | Plato's metempsychosis |
| Egyptian | Ka/Ba persist after death |

## 2.2 MODERN SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH

### Pre-Stevenson

| Researcher | Year | Contribution |
|------------|------|--------------|
| Gustave Geley | 1920s | Early documentation |
| F.W.H. Myers | 1903 | "Human Personality and its Survival" |
| Various | 1900-1960 | Anecdotal collections |

### Ian Stevenson Era (1960-2007)

**Key publications:**

1. **"Twenty Cases Suggestive of Reincarnation" (1966)**
   - First rigorous study
   - Cases from India, Ceylon, Brazil

2. **"Cases of the Reincarnation Type" (4 volumes, 1975-1983)**
   - Detailed case studies by region
   - Methodology refined

3. **"Where Reincarnation and Biology Intersect" (1997)**
   - 200+ birthmark cases
   - Medical documentation

4. **"Reincarnation and Biology: A Contribution to the Etiology of Birthmarks and Birth Defects" (1997)**
   - 2,200 pages
   - 225 cases with photographs

### Post-Stevenson (2007-Present)

| Researcher | Work |
|------------|------|
| **Jim Tucker** | Continuing at UVA, 2,500+ additional cases |
| **Erlendur Haraldsson** | European cases |
| **Satwant Pasricha** | India-based research |
| **Antonia Mills** | Cross-cultural analysis |

## 2.3 PEER-REVIEWED PUBLICATIONS

### Journal Articles

1. Stevenson, I. (1977). "Reincarnation: Field studies and theoretical issues." *Handbook of Parapsychology*.

2. Tucker, J. (2000). "A scale to measure the strength of children's claims of previous lives." *Journal of Scientific Exploration*.

3. Tucker, J. (2005). "Life Before Life: Children's Memories of Previous Lives." *Journal of Scientific Exploration*, 19(4).

4. Haraldsson, E. (2003). "Children who speak of past-life experiences." *Journal of Scientific Exploration*, 17(2).

### Academic Recognition

- Division of Perceptual Studies at UVA (established)
- Peer review of methodology
- Replication by independent researchers
- Cross-cultural verification

## 2.4 CRITICISM AND RESPONSE

### Common Criticisms

| Criticism | Stevenson's Response |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Fraud | Detailed investigation, families often disadvantaged by claims |
| Parental leading | Statements recorded before verification |
| Cultural contamination | Occurs in skeptical cultures too |
| Selection bias | Negative cases also documented |
| Memory construction | Verified details impossible to guess |

### Why Skeptics Remain

```
CHALLENGES:
• Consciousness survival contradicts materialism
• No known mechanism
• Exceptional claim requires exceptional evidence
• Difficult to replicate on demand

RESPONSE:
• Evidence is strong even if mechanism unknown
• Quantum mechanics also lacks intuitive mechanism
• Replication exists across researchers and cultures

## 2.5 GAP IN LITERATURE

Current research lacks:

1. **Integration with consciousness studies** — How does NDE research connect?
2. **Mechanism explanation** — What physically transfers?
3. **Framework for understanding** — Why only some remember?
4. **Theoretical model** — What is "reincarnating"?

**This paper addresses these gaps** through the Backend Framework.
