|   PRECOGNITION = AKASHIC ACCESS                                          |
|   (Reading from the Cosmic Database)                                      |
|                                                                           |
|   THE AKASHIC RECORDS:                                                    |
|   ===================                                                     |
|   • Cosmic database containing ALL events                                |
|   • Past, present, AND future stored                                     |
|   • Accessible through consciousness                                     |
|   • Located in Akasha (ether/space)                                      |
|                                                                           |
|   WHY FUTURE IS ACCESSIBLE:                                               |
|   =========================                                               |
|   • Time is linear only in Saguna (manifest reality)                     |
|   • In Nirguna (pure consciousness), all time is NOW                     |
|   • Akashic Records exist in Nirguna                                     |
|   • Access requires transcending linear time                             |
|                                                                           |
|   HOW IT WORKS:                                                           |
|   =============                                                           |
|   1. Consciousness rises above Manas (lower mind)                        |
|   2. Accesses Buddhi (higher intellect)                                  |
|   3. Buddhi reads from Akasha                                            |
|   4. Information filters down as intuition                               |
|   5. Mind interprets (often with distortion)                             |
|                                                                           |
|   WHY IMPERFECT:                                                          |
|   =============                                                           |
|   • Multiple probable futures (branching)                                |
|   • Interpretation through personal lens                                 |
|   • Karma can shift timelines                                            |
|   • Observer effect in quantum terms                                     |
|                                                                           |
