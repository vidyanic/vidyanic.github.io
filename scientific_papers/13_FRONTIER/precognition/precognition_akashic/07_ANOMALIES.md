# 7. ANOMALIES

## 7.1 Causality Anomalies

### 7.1.1 Retroactive Influence

```
THE ANOMALY:
===========

Bem studies show:
• Future study session affects past performance
• Practice AFTER test improves test score
• Effect precedes cause

STANDARD: Impossible, must be artifact
BACKEND: Nirguna time is non-linear
         Future and past connected
         "Cause" and "effect" are rendered
```

### 7.1.2 Pre-Stimulus Response

```
THE ANOMALY:
===========

Body responds before stimulus:
• Skin conductance 2-6 seconds early
• Heart rate change before image
• Stimulus is truly random

STANDARD: Statistical artifact
BACKEND: Body reads from Akasha
         Future is accessible
         Pranamaya senses before Manas knows
```

## 7.2 Accuracy Anomalies

### 7.2.1 Inconsistent Accuracy

```
THE ANOMALY:
===========

Precognition is not reliably accurate:
• Sometimes right
• Sometimes wrong
• Pattern unclear

STANDARD: It's not real
BACKEND: Multiple probable futures
         Reading probability, not certainty
         Actions change trajectory
         One of many branches accessed
```

### 7.2.2 Symbolic vs Literal

```
THE ANOMALY:
===========

Precognitive content often symbolic:
• Metaphorical rather than literal
• Requires interpretation
• Can be misread

STANDARD: Memory confabulation
BACKEND: Buddhi information passes through Manas
         Manas translates into its language
         Symbols are Manas vocabulary
         Literal is rare (higher access)
```

## 7.3 Selectivity Anomalies

### 7.3.1 Emotional Bias

```
THE ANOMALY:
===========

Precognition biased toward:
• Emotional content
• Personal relevance
• Survival information

Why not random access?

BACKEND: Emotional events have stronger Akashic imprint
         Personal karma creates resonance
         Survival = Dharmic priority
         Not random reading but resonance
```

### 7.3.2 Who Gets Access

```
THE ANOMALY:
===========

Some people report more precognition:
• Meditators
• Intuitives
• Children
• Artists

Why not universal?

BACKEND: Access requires consciousness elevation
         Sattva facilitates
         Children = Less Manas noise
         Manas blocks access in most
```

## 7.4 Free Will Anomalies

### 7.4.1 Paradox of Changing Future

```
THE ANOMALY:
===========

If future is known, can it be changed?
If changed, was it really the future?
Paradox of predetermined vs free will.

BACKEND RESOLUTION:
• Multiple probable futures exist
• Precognition reads one probability
• Free will (Sankalpa) can shift
• What was seen was TRUE — for that branch
• Your action created different branch
```

### 7.4.2 Self-Fulfilling Prophecy

```
THE ANOMALY:
===========

Sometimes knowing future creates it:
• Prophecy causes what it predicts
• Is it precognition or causation?

BACKEND: Both
         Future influenced present (precognition)
         Present influenced future (Sankalpa)
         Indrajal connects both directions
```

## 7.5 How Backend Resolves

| Anomaly | Resolution |
|---------|------------|
| Retroactive | Nirguna time non-linear |
| Pre-stimulus | Pranamaya Akashic access |
| Inconsistent accuracy | Multiple futures |
| Symbolic content | Manas translation |
| Emotional bias | Rasa intensity |
| Selective access | Sattva requirement |
| Free will paradox | Branching realities |
| Self-fulfilling | Bidirectional causation |

## 7.6 Remaining Questions

1. **Mechanism** — Exact physics-consciousness interface
2. **Reliability** — How to improve accuracy
3. **Training** — Can access be systematically developed?
4. **Limits** — How far ahead is accessible?
