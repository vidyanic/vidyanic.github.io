## 1.1 The Phenomenon of Precognition

Can we know the future before it happens? Reports throughout history include:

- Prophetic dreams
- Premonitions before disasters
- "Knowing" before being told
- Intuitive foreknowledge
- Déjà vu (already seen)

---

## 1.2 The Scientific Tension

### 1.2.1 Why It "Can't" Happen

Classical physics says:
- Causality flows past -> future
- Effect cannot precede cause
- Future doesn't exist yet
- Information can't travel backward

### 1.2.2 But Evidence Suggests...

- Statistically significant lab results (Bem, 2011)
- Presentiment (body knows before mind)
- Cross-cultural consistency
- Block universe physics allows it

## 1.3 The Backend Framework

### 1.3.1 Akashic Records

> **"आकाश" = Space/Ether**

The Akashic Records are:
- Cosmic database of all events
- Past, present, AND future stored
- Accessible through consciousness
- Located in Akasha (subtlest element)

### 1.3.2 Time in Backend

```
TWO VIEWS OF TIME:
=================

SAGUNA (Manifest):
• Time is linear
• Past -> Present -> Future
• Cause precedes effect
• This is how Maya renders

NIRGUNA (Unmanifest):
• All time is NOW
• Past/present/future coexist
• Akashic Records accessible
• This is Brahman's view
```

## 1.4 Why This Matters

Understanding precognition:
- Validates non-linear time models
- Connects physics with consciousness
- Explains universal human experience
- Supports Backend Framework

## 1.5 Paper Structure

This paper will:
1. Review precognition research
2. Present the Akashic Records model
3. Correlate with block universe physics
4. Validate against 7-concept stack
5. Discuss implications
