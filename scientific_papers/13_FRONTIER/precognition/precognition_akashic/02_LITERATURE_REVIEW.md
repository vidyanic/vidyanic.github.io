# 2. LITERATURE REVIEW

---

## 2.1 Historical Reports

### 2.1.1 Ancient Records

- Oracle of Delphi
- Biblical prophecy
- Hindu/Buddhist seers
- Cross-cultural prophetic traditions

### 2.1.2 Modern Reports

- Lincoln dreaming his death
- Titanic premonitions
- 9/11 precognitive dreams
- Disaster premonitions consistently documented

## 2.2 Scientific Research

### 2.2.1 Bem's Studies (2011)

*Feeling the Future*:
- 9 experiments, 8 showed effect
- ~1,000 participants
- Retroactive priming effects
- p < 0.01 cumulative

Controversy:
- Replication attempts mixed
- Methodological debates
- But meta-analyses support small effect

### 2.2.2 Presentiment Research

**Radin (1997-2010):**
- Skin conductance before random stimuli
- Heart rate changes before emotional images
- 2-6 second anticipation
- Replicated in multiple labs

**Bierman (2000):**
- Independent replication
- fMRI showing brain anticipation
- Significant results

### 2.2.3 Meta-Analyses

**Mossbridge et al. (2012):**
- 26 studies analyzed
- Significant aggregate effect
- Effect size small but consistent
- Body predicts future stimuli

## 2.3 Physics Frameworks

### 2.3.1 Block Universe

Einstein's relativity implies:
- Past, present, future equally real
- Time is a dimension, not a flow
- All moments exist "simultaneously"
- Accessing future is theoretically possible

### 2.3.2 Retrocausality

Some interpretations allow:
- Future affects past
- Transactional interpretation (Cramer)
- Absorber theory
- Time symmetry in equations

### 2.4.1 Akashic Records

> **"आकाशात्पतितं तोयं यथा गच्छति सागरम्"**
> "As water fallen from sky returns to the ocean..."
> — Chanakya Niti

### 2.4.2 Trikala-Jnana

> **"त्रिकालज्ञ" = Knower of Three Times**

Yogis described as "Trikala-Jna" — knowing past, present, future.

### 2.4.3 Yoga Sutras

> **"भूतभविष्यद्वर्तमानसंयमात्..."**
> "By Samyama on past and future..."
> — Yoga Sutras 3.16
