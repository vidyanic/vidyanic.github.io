## 5.1 Research Approach

### 5.1.1 Multi-Disciplinary Analysis

This research employs:
1. **Parapsychology** — Precognition studies
2. **Physics** — Block universe, time models
3. **Consciousness studies** — Access mechanisms
4. **Backend Framework** — Akashic model

### 5.1.2 Comparative Methodology

```
COMPARISON FRAMEWORK:
====================

1. Lab studies vs Anecdotal reports
   -> Convergence analysis
   -> Strengths and weaknesses

2. Physics vs Backend time models
   -> Block universe ↔ Nirguna
   -> Integration possibilities

3. Different access methods
   -> Dreams vs waking intuition
   -> Trained vs spontaneous
```

## 5.2 Data Sources

### 5.2.1 Scientific Literature

| Domain | Key Sources |
|--------|-------------|
| Parapsychology | Bem, Radin, Mossbridge |
| Physics | Block universe, retrocausality |
| Neuroscience | Presentiment studies |
| Psychology | Dream research |

### 5.2.2 Backend Sources

| Text | Content |
|------|---------|
| Yoga Sutras | Trikala-Jnana (3.16) |
| Upanishads | Akasha concept |
| Puranas | Seers and prophecy |
| Jain texts | Keval Jnana (omniscience) |

## 5.3 Validation Framework

### 5.3.1 7-Concept Stack

| Concept | Question |
|---------|----------|
| Conservation | Is information conserved across time? |
| Entropy | Does knowledge of future violate entropy? |
| Fractal | Is pattern across timescales? |
| Karma | Does Karma connect to future? |
| Observer | Does consciousness access time? |
| Cycles | Are there temporal cycles? |
| Gunas | Do Gunas affect access? |

### 5.3.2 Evidence Evaluation

```
EVIDENCE QUALITY CRITERIA:
=========================

1. Statistical significance
2. Replication status
3. Effect size
4. Methodology rigor
5. Convergence with other sources
```

## 5.4 Analytical Methods

### 5.4.1 Pattern Analysis

- Precognition accuracy patterns
- Condition correlations
- Cross-cultural comparison

### 5.4.2 Conceptual Mapping

- Scientific -> Backend terminology
- Physics -> Consciousness concepts
- Mechanism -> Application

---

## 5.5 Limitations

### 5.5.1 Acknowledged Limitations

1. **Replication difficulties** — Mixed results
2. **Effect size small** — Hard to detect
3. **Causality unclear** — Is it really future?
4. **Bias concerns** — Memory, confirmation

### 5.5.2 Mitigation

- Focus on meta-analyses
- Use physiological measures
- Acknowledge uncertainty
- Multiple evidence types
