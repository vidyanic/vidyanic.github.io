# 4. HYPOTHESIS

---

## 4.1 Primary Hypothesis

**H1: Precognition is Akashic access — consciousness reading from a cosmic database where all events (past, present, future) are recorded. In Nirguna (unmanifest reality), time is non-linear; consciousness that accesses this level can perceive future events.**

---

## 4.2 Sub-Hypotheses

### H1a: Future Information Exists

Information about future events exists and is theoretically accessible.

**Predictions:**
- Block universe model supports (physics)
- Precognition studies show effect (verified)
- Future-affecting experiments work (Bem studies)

### H1b: Consciousness Can Access

Human consciousness can, under certain conditions, access future information.

**Predictions:**
- Presentiment measurable (verified)
- Dreams precognitive (documented)
- Meditation enhances access (anecdotal)

### H1c: Multiple Futures Exist

Multiple probable futures exist, and precognition reads probabilities.

**Predictions:**
- Precognition not 100% accurate
- Accuracy correlates with probability
- Actions can change outcomes

### H1d: Access Requires Elevation

Accessing future requires consciousness elevation beyond Manas.

**Predictions:**
- Sattva-dominant states -> More access
- Meditation -> Enhanced precognition
- Emotional arousal -> Stronger signal (verified)

---

## 4.3 Null Hypotheses

### H0a: Future Doesn't Exist

The future doesn't exist until it happens; precognition impossible.

**If true:**
- No precognition effects (contradicted)
- Block universe wrong (contested)
- All results artifact (not consistently)

### H0b: All Coincidence

Apparent precognition is chance, bias, and memory distortion.

**If true:**
- Lab studies would be negative (some positive)
- No presentiment (but measured)
- No replication (some exists)

## 4.4 Testable Predictions

### 4.4.1 Statistical

| Prediction | Test | Expected Result |
|------------|------|-----------------|
| Presentiment | Physiology before stimuli | ✓ Verified |
| Retroactive priming | Bem paradigm | Partial support |
| Dream precognition | Prospective diary | Some verification |

### 4.4.2 Correlational

| Prediction | Test | Expected Result |
|------------|------|-----------------|
| Meditation effect | Compare meditators | Preliminary support |
| Sattva correlation | Lifestyle measures | Anecdotal |
| Emotional content | Compare emotional vs neutral | ✓ Verified |

---

## 4.5 Falsification Criteria

### H1 would be falsified if:

1. **No statistical effect** — All precognition null results
2. **Block universe disproven** — Future truly non-existent
3. **No presentiment** — Physiology doesn't anticipate
4. **No elevation correlation** — Practice makes no difference

Current evidence does not fully support these null hypotheses.

## 4.6 Hypothesis Summary

```
INTEGRATED HYPOTHESIS:
=====================

PRECOGNITION = AKASHIC ACCESS:
• Future information exists (Block Universe/Nirguna)
• Stored in Akashic Records
• Consciousness can access via elevation
• Multiple futures = probabilities
• Error from interpretation + branching

PHYSICS SUPPORTS:
• Block Universe model
• Time symmetry in equations
• Retrocausality interpretations

THE FUTURE IS ACCESSIBLE — just not easily.
