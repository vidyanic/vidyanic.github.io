## 💡 The Key Insight

**Why study frontier sciences?**

If even ONE of these is real:
- NDE -> Consciousness survives death
- Reincarnation -> Karma is real
- Synchronicity -> Everything is connected
- Precognition -> Time is not linear

**These aren't fringe topics — they're central to understanding reality.**

```
MAINSTREAM SCIENCE:
Consciousness = brain -> Death = end

FRONTIER EVIDENCE + VEDIC KNOWLEDGE:
Consciousness = primary -> Death = transition
