# 2. LITERATURE REVIEW

## 2.1 Jung's Work

### 2.1.1 Original Formulation (1952)

*Synchronicity: An Acausal Connecting Principle*:
- Meaningful coincidences without causal connection
- Evidence for collective unconscious
- Archetypes as organizing principles
- Connection to physics (Pauli collaboration)

### 2.1.2 Key Examples

- Scarab beetle case
- Patient dreams/real-world parallels
- I Ching correlations
- Meaningful number sequences

## 2.2 Psi Research

### 2.2.1 Princeton PEAR Lab

Engineering Anomalies Research (1979-2007):
- Random number generator (RNG) studies
- Mind influences randomness
- Small but consistent effects
- p < 0.05 repeatedly

### 2.2.2 Global Consciousness Project

Roger Nelson et al.:
- Network of RNGs worldwide
- Measure during global events
- 9/11: Significant deviation
- Major disasters: Patterns appear

### 2.2.3 Presentiment Research

Dean Radin et al.:
- Physiological response BEFORE random stimuli
- Skin conductance, heart rate changes
- Body "knows" before conscious mind
- Replicated in multiple labs

---

## 2.3 Quantum Physics Parallels

### 2.3.1 Entanglement

- Particles correlated regardless of distance
- Measurement of one affects other
- "Spooky action at a distance"
- Non-local correlation is real

### 2.3.2 Bell's Theorem

- No local hidden variables
- Reality is non-local OR non-realistic
- Verified experimentally
- Physics allows for connection without causation

## 2.4 Collective Consciousness

### 2.4.1 Morphic Fields

Rupert Sheldrake:
- Fields carrying information
- Learning spreads non-locally
- Rats in one lab, others learn faster
- Controversial but intriguing

### 2.4.2 Maharishi Effect

Transcendental Meditation studies:
- Group meditation correlates with reduced crime
- Statistical significance in some studies
- Mechanism debated
- Consciousness may affect collective

## 2.5 Backend Framework Sources

### 2.5.1 Indrajal

> **"इन्द्रो मायाभिः पुरुरूप ईयते"**
> "Indra, through Maya, appears in many forms."
> — Rig Veda 6.47.18

### 2.5.2 Net of Brahman

> **"यथा तन्तुस्तन्तुनातो यथा"**
> "As threads are woven together..."
> — Chandogya Upanishad

### 2.5.3 One Appearing as Many

> **"एकं सद्विप्रा बहुधा वदन्ति"**
> "Truth is one, sages call it by many names."
> — Rig Veda 1.164.46

## 2.6 Research Gaps

| Gap | Current Status | This Paper's Contribution |
|-----|----------------|--------------------------|
| Mechanism | Unknown | Indrajal model |
| Consciousness role | Debated | Sankalpa activation |
| Integration | None | Backend framework |
| Validation | Limited | 7-concept stack |
