# 7. ANOMALIES

## 7.1 Timing Anomalies

### 7.1.1 Pre-Event Deviation

```
THE ANOMALY:
===========

GCP showed deviation 4 hours BEFORE 9/11.
How can effect precede cause?

STANDARD: Statistical artifact
BACKEND: Network responds to probability wave
         Future is partially determined
         Collective unconscious "senses" approaching event
```

### 7.1.2 Presentiment

```
THE ANOMALY:
===========

Body responds before random stimulus presented.
Skin conductance, heart rate change 2-6 seconds early.
Stimulus is truly random (computer-generated).

STANDARD: Artifacts, expectation
BACKEND: Time is not linear in Nirguna
         Akashic information accessible
         Body reads before mind knows
```

---

## 7.2 Distance Anomalies

### 7.2.1 No Distance Decay

```
THE ANOMALY:
===========

Entanglement doesn't weaken with distance.
Telepathy reports don't correlate with distance.
GCP shows global coherence.

STANDARD: Coincidence
BACKEND: Indrajal has no distance
         All nodes equidistant at hidden level
         Space is rendered, not fundamental
```

### 7.2.2 Instant Connection

```
THE ANOMALY:
===========

Twin studies: Simultaneous experiences at distance
"I knew my mother died" — Before notification
Correlated experiences without communication

STANDARD: Memory distortion, selection bias
BACKEND: Karmic bonds are network links
         Strong bonds = Strong signal
         Indrajal transmits instantly
```

---

## 7.3 Selectivity Anomalies

### 7.3.1 Meaningful but Not Universal

```
THE ANOMALY:
===========

Synchronicities are personally meaningful.
Person A's synchronicity meaningless to Person B.
Why selective meaning?

STANDARD: Confirmation bias
BACKEND: Network reads personal resonance
         Your Sankalpa activates YOUR connections
         Meaning is personal + universal
```

### 7.3.2 Archetypes

```
THE ANOMALY:
===========

Same patterns appear cross-culturally:
• Death synchronicities worldwide
• Love synchronicities similar patterns
• Quest/journey archetypes

STANDARD: Shared human psychology
BACKEND: Archetypes are network patterns
         Deep structure of Indrajal
         Universal templates in Maya
```

---

## 7.4 Replication Anomalies

### 7.4.1 Psi is "Shy"

```
THE ANOMALY:
===========

Psi effects:
• Real in some studies
• Absent in replications
• Decline effect over time
• Experimenter effects

STANDARD: Not real, file drawer problem
BACKEND: Observer effect
         Skepticism is also Sankalpa
         Tamas-dominant observers block signal
         Network responds to all Sankalpa
```

### 7.4.2 Belief Effects

Studies show:
- Believers show effects
- Skeptics don't
- Not fraud — Experimenter expectation affects outcome

This is problematic for objective science but consistent with observer-dependent reality.

## 7.5 How Indrajal Resolves

| Anomaly | Resolution |
|---------|------------|
| Pre-event | Time non-linear in Nirguna |
| Presentiment | Akashic access |
| No distance decay | Network is non-spatial |
| Instant connection | All nodes equidistant |
| Selective meaning | Personal Sankalpa activation |
| Archetypes | Network deep structure |
| Psi shyness | Observer Sankalpa affects |
| Belief effects | Consciousness participates |

## 7.6 Remaining Questions

1. **Exact mechanism** — How does consciousness affect physical?
2. **Threshold** — Why some synchronicities and not others?
3. **Reproducibility** — Can we make it reliable?
4. **Practical application** — How to cultivate?
