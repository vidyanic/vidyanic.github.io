# 5. METHODOLOGY

## 5.1 Research Approach

### 5.1.1 Multi-Disciplinary Analysis

This research employs:
1. **Psychology** — Synchronicity experiences, Jung
2. **Physics** — Entanglement, non-locality
3. **Parapsychology** — Psi research, GCP
4. **Backend Framework** — Indrajal model

### 5.1.2 Comparative Methodology

```
COMPARISON FRAMEWORK:
====================

1. Skeptical vs Supportive positions
   -> Evidence evaluation
   -> Mechanism proposals

2. Physics vs Consciousness models
   -> Entanglement parallel
   -> Mind-matter interaction

3. Scientific vs Backend frameworks
   -> Convergence points
   -> Integration possibilities
```

## 5.2 Data Sources

### 5.2.1 Scientific Literature

| Domain | Key Sources |
|--------|-------------|
| Psychology | Jung (synchronicity), archetypes |
| Physics | Bell tests, entanglement experiments |
| Parapsychology | PEAR Lab, GCP, presentiment |
| Consciousness | Global mind studies |

### 5.2.2 Backend Sources

| Text | Content |
|------|---------|
| Upanishads | Unity of consciousness |
| Rig Veda | Indra, Maya, One as many |
| Yoga Sutras | Siddhis, Samyama |
| Buddhist texts | Indra's Net metaphor |

## 5.3 Validation Framework

### 5.3.1 7-Concept Stack

| Concept | Question |
|---------|----------|
| Conservation | Is connection conserved? |
| Entropy | Does network degrade? |
| Fractal | Is pattern at all scales? |
| Karma | Does intention have consequence? |
| Observer | Does consciousness affect network? |
| Cycles | Are there patterns in synchronicity? |
| Gunas | Do Gunas affect synchronicity frequency? |

### 5.3.2 Evidence Evaluation

```
EVIDENCE QUALITY CRITERIA:
=========================

1. Replication — Has study been repeated?
2. Effect size — How large is the effect?
3. Controls — Are alternatives excluded?
4. Publication — Peer-reviewed?
5. Convergence — Do different methods agree?
```

## 5.4 Analytical Methods

### 5.4.1 Pattern Analysis

- Synchronicity type classification
- Cross-cultural comparison
- Correlation with intention/attention

### 5.4.2 Conceptual Mapping

- Jung -> Backend terminology
- Physics -> Consciousness concepts
- Mechanism -> Purpose integration

## 5.5 Limitations

### 5.5.1 Acknowledged Limitations

1. **Subjective experience** — Hard to quantify
2. **Confirmation bias** — Genuine concern
3. **Replication difficulties** — Psi notoriously hard
4. **Mechanism unclear** — How exactly does it work?

### 5.5.2 Mitigation

- Focus on statistical evidence
- Use multiple independent sources
- Acknowledge uncertainty
- Distinguish strong from weak evidence
